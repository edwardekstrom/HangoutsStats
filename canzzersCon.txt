Colby Condie

John Sherwood
So I'm trying to understand the grey boxes with pictures. So if they've read the message.. then their box goes away?
Merit Egan
the box goes down as far as they have read.
so colby has read since his comment
hasn't
Edward Ekstrom
And when it is not greyed out, that means they are looking at the conversation.
Merit Egan
Who's down for a video call at 4:30?
Test it out.
Edward Ekstrom
I can at 5
Merit Egan
5 it is
Edward Ekstrom
We need voxerers to get in here for the maiden voyage!

Edward Ekstrom
Your oriental roots make you a master of all things zen.
Just like my mexican roots make me an excellent drug dealer.

Merit Egan
Go to the main hangout page, find settings, and you'll see it
And excellent at making burritos
Edward Ekstrom
Yup

Jeff Knudsen

Friday, September 20, 2013 8:34 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, she's not coming until next week. I was mistaken
Jeff Knudsen
oh, ok. But don't tell her to contact me.  I want it to be her idea if she does
Edward Ekstrom
Okay.  Are you at all interested do you think?
Friday, September 20, 2013 12:58 PM
Merit Egan
Im not. What are we doing tonight. Halo? Vball? Nightswimming deserves a quiet night? Fifa?
John Sherwood
Vball. Or feefster.
Merit Egan
our friends hate us. It's been 23 minutes
John Sherwood
Gosh.. Google hangouts allow us to see our true friendships huh merit?
Merit Egan
Yeah that's for sure. Maybe the true fans should unite and cheer for the same football team. Not BYU or Utah. How about Alabama? I don't think they are very good, and I don't want to jump on any bandwagon, so it's best to choose a mediocre team.
true friends
John Sherwood
Hmm I can dig it. Let's dig it tonight. Over volleyball
Colby Condie
Ciao amici
zach fackrell
Volleyball I'm in
Iphone5s nigggggasssssssss
Merit Egan
Galaxy s4 ah yeah biotches

the nano.
Edward Ekstrom
Gs4 in da hood in da hood
Colby Condie
Eddy made the switch
Merit Egan
it's true. And he's never been happier. How do you think he found Annie? At the Galaxy store.
Free cool wife with galaxy phone
Colby Condie
Hahahahaha
Part of a two year contract. After two years though, you need to pick a new wife
zach fackrell
*free wifi, not wife merit
Merit Egan
really? I've been so confused. I kept seeing the same thing at mcdonalds. I thought, Man, they are giving away a lot of free wifes
starbucks gives away free wives too.
and the airport.
Colby Condie
And the DI on 9400 south
Merit Egan
haha some quality wives there.
zach fackrell
Ya I saw that a lot in Europe. You can usually get away with getting free wives though with your American accent. " I no can speak German " boom. Wife
Colby Condie
So true Zach. We got so many wives that way
Really made the trip easier
Merit Egan
they just cook for you
Colby Condie
Cumber buns
Merit Egan
Cummerbund
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Black ottoman silk cummerbund, for black tie
A cummerbund is a broad waist sash, usually pleated, which is often worn with single-breasted dinner jackets (or tuxedos).[1] The cummerbund was first adopted by British military officers in colonial India as an alternative to a waistcoat, and later spread to civilian use. The modern use of the cummerbund is as a component of black tie.
Cumber Bun is a way better word, and what everyone told us they were. Not Cummerbund. All in favor of a name change?
Colby Condie
I
John Sherwood
Aye
What time should we volley?
Merit Egan
Let's shoot for a little earlier than usual? like 7:30? Multihour volleyball, fun hangout after?
or the usual 8:30?
John Sherwood
Whichever is fine with me.. we could get a smaller group at 7 to play tennis.. then volleyball at 830
Or... ju and I are going up a canyon and hiking around abit at 5 or something. Anyone is welcome
Fitness day
Colby Condie
I unfortunately will not make it tonight. Plans with Minster (Minni)

Edward Ekstrom
Amy's hours has two rooms with big tvs. One for merit and Jeff and one for the rest of us.
Bryan Samuelson

Edward Ekstrom

Bryan Samuelson
Haha exactly. If the game gets tense, I will participate in all unity circles and other camaraderie and momentum building exercises via this google vox
Edward Ekstrom
Good.
Tell Cesil sorry that he has to be president of BYU.
That's quite a burden to bare.
bear
Bryan Samuelson
It really is. It's been a strain for the entire family
Brayden Haws
Make sure you sneak some cinnamon bears into the game Bryan. I'm sure they don't sell those there
Edward Ekstrom
And sneak coke in, they will all think you are a rebel
Merit Egan
And go fake baptize people so they know you are a utah fan.
Edward Ekstrom
But don't break any real commandments or they will think you play for the team..
The BYU team that is
John Sherwood
Or baptize for the dead with all the ordinances to show you are a child of god and no matter which team they rooted for it doesn't matter. We all love each other.
Edward Ekstrom
Good john, peacemaker
Bryan Samuelson
Indeed, well done John
Merit Egan
I love you guys
Edward Ekstrom
Rise and shout the Utes are out and they love the Cougars tooooooo.
I am a BYU man and I live in the celestial king, with all the Utah men because we're all so clean.
Brayden Haws
I love everyone in this gh, ute, cougar, vandal, green wave, Atlanta falcon all are the same in my eyes
Merit Egan
It doesnt matter if you you are green, purple, black, Asian, middle eastern, indian, Scandinavian, mexican, Australian, antartcanian, or alien. MLK set us all free.
Edward Ekstrom
Has anyone seen that movie about the butler?
Annie and I saw it last night, it is really intense
John Sherwood
Lds, Catholic, Presbyterian, protestant.. martin Luther and his 95 theses provided us that freedom. Not really
But it started the reformation
Edward Ekstrom
True True, double True
John Sherwood
I've heard it is great ed. Did you enjoy?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, Annie was crying for the first hour
nonstop
Merit Egan
Actually, if you are purple I might be a little scared.
Edward Ekstrom
you mean sacred maret
merit
"I might be a little sacred"
we don't say scary words in this gh vox
only peaceful, holy words
Merit Egan
Secret, eddy. Its secret, not sacred.
Edward Ekstrom
I see
Is teezer in here?
John Sherwood
Negative.. he needs a computer to use it. His phone won't allow it
Edward Ekstrom
Someone help his soul tonight
Merit Egan
Yes I tried real hard. I uninsralled it and reinstalled it. He can sign into google+, but hangouts won't work.
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
Indeed. School sucks, cause then you have homework. Why homework, why. And the stupid intranet (internet) just makes so you have more homework
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, it's like your professor can follow you around all day and assign you more things to do
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom

It's vicious

Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
As of about a week ago, I did know that.
#antiBryanWinter
Merit Egan
Tyson, how did you get this working on you phone?
Football on your phone
Brayden Haws
I fixed it
#goldenthumb
John Sherwood
Bsam.. was it karla malone?
Bryan Samuelson
It was indeed. #BryansSummer
Jeff Knudsen
Karla malone?  what does that even mean?
Tyson Amundsen
John great nickname christening. I just thought we needed to be aware of this
Jeff Knudsen
Bryan has a lady!?!?!?!?!?
Brayden Haws
Jeff Bryan's got 5 or 6 girlfriends and a wife on the side
Jeff Knudsen
I understand
Bryan Samuelson
Thank you for clarifying Haws
Colby Condie
What we all don't know is that when Bryan is studying physics he is actually with one of his women
Jeff Knudsen
PHYSICS and CHEMISTRY AYOOOOO
Tyson Amundsen
Also anatomy and physiology #bryanthescientist
Colby Condie
Hahaha guys pause you are all funny
Jeff Knudsen

Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws

Jeff Knudsen
Dang, I knew the girl i am dating was lying to me
Colby Condie

Merit Egan

Jeff Knudsen
She is one of the cheetah girls from disney channel
Merit Egan

Colb
Brayden Haws

Merit Egan
Where are your priorities HeHaws?
Brayden Haws
Haws 1 priorities are obviously with you. Thus I informed you why I missed rather than just skipping the call and not explaining my self
Colby Condie


Monday, September 23, 2013 7:42 AM
Edward Ekstrom
So sleepy
Brayden Haws
Muffins major at the institute
Edward Ekstrom
I want moofins
Brayden Haws
Poppy seed and choc
Jeff Knudsen
I am the moofin man
Edward Ekstrom
What do you iPhoners think of ios 7?
Brayden Haws
It's pretty good. It's not as applish, it's like a blend of android/windows
Apple-ish
Edward Ekstrom
I'm putting it on my work phone right now to check it out
Any glitches so far?
Brayden Haws
Nah it's running pretty smoothly
But I still want a galaxy
Edward Ekstrom
when do you get an upgrade?
Merit Egan
The galaxy note 3 comes out in a week. It's a toss up between the note 3 and s4.
Edward Ekstrom
Isn't that a tablet?
Brayden Haws
My mom has a note, that thing is too big. You'd have to wear a gabby pack to carry it
Merit Egan
It's a phablet.
Edward Ekstrom
S4 is plenty big
Jeff Knudsen
I prefer the DeROID
Merit Egan
Yeah I like the s4 size. Its like the bowl of pourage that goldie locks ate. Just right.
Edward Ekstrom
And it has 80211ac unlike the iPhone 5
Jeff Knudsen
that's what i just said
Who knew phones came with air conditioners nowadays
Merit Egan
And it has a touch screen
I'm not pushing buttons, im just touching letters on my screen.
Edward Ekstrom
I'm talking to my phone
seriously
John Sherwood

Slutsky
Riveting
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
I'm done with all my math classes but I need one more for a minor. Should I do it?
Merit Egan
Music update
John Sherwood
Ya man. Admirable for your application. Take number theory or cryptography.
Edward Ekstrom
Are they hard?
John Sherwood
Nope. I actually haven't taken cryptography but I've been to a few classes and it looked amazing. Number theory is way easy and easy cool
Edward Ekstrom
Gooooot
John Sherwood
Didn't mean to say "easy cool" but I'm not going to correct it
Merit Egan


John Sherwood
Slutskys thm is probably the funniest theorem I've come across
Merit Egan
We're vincible
Tyson Amundsen
John, what does slutskys theory essentially tell us?
Brayden Haws
I believe it helps you determine which girls in a group are easiest to get with
Merit Egan
Thats right. It takes the thickness of their makeup, divided by the dye in their hair, multiplied by the inverse reciprocal of their high heel size.
John Sherwood
It's true.. if a sequence (call her X_n or Susan) converges to a constant (or a certain constant of a guy) and then another sequence in the group (say Y_n or Pam) also converges to another set of functions (or group of guys. Jocks or nerds or something) then... if Susan and Pam search fit boys they will find that boy and the nerds.
And get with them
In mathematical trends
Terms*
Tyson Amundsen
Whew. That's deep stuff, tough to comprehend
Brayden Haws
What if you're married? Is slutskys of any use then?
John Sherwood
We then refer you to chastityskys theorem
And that just quotes D&C 42:22
Merit Egan

Leggy leggy leggy leggy
Colby Condie
Erstwhile, I just beat a kid from Vietnam in
Badminton
Tyson Amundsen
Gosh dang communists. Pho
Edward Ekstrom
Want to know who's a Slutsky? The kid in my group who doesn't do any work.

Merit Egan
Those refs are pretty bad. Messed up the wisconsin ASU game last week.
Colby Condie
Yeah I read they were the same refs
But that Wisconsin game ending was one of the worst pieces of officiating I've ever seen
Merit Egan
Yeah, they were reprimanded but they should have had to go to retarded correcting school.
Ive never seen anything that bad. Besides steve javi of course.
Colby Condie
And the replacement refs in that Seahawks game last season..
And of course the jacka** refs who screwed over Chronic Terror's hopes of a world championship last season...
We coulda gone all the way. No doubt. No doubt in my mind
Merit Egan
Haha yes all those examples are spot on.
John Sherwood
Are you disappointed with the refs on Sunday merit?
Merit Egan
are you asking about Saturday?
John Sherwood
Ya that's what I meant
Merit Egan
I don't think they were very good, but for both sides. A lot of missed P.I. calls and some phantom calls.
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah they weren't the best but I agree, they were bad both ways.
Merit Egan
Yeah, really the only game changing call was the kick return for a td, which they didnt show a replay of so I dont know. From the radio I hear it was questionable.
Colby Condie
Guys look for me on TV at the Georgia LSU game. I'll be half naked. From the waist down
Merit Egan
Colby knows his audience
Merit Egan
i've been in class for 3 hours and I have more than 2 hours left. FML

Will we be able to get in the church tonight?
Jeff Knudsen
I want to play.  Eddy teleport us up there
John Sherwood
Will there be ward games there?
Colby Condie
Zach is the keeper of the keys. And it sounds like he will be late with Bryan
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, that's ridiculous. What I would like to work on is making our smartphones the keys to our car.
Jeff Knudsen
I said Joe Montainya!
Edward Ekstrom
NFC is going to allow us to only carry around our phones
Unlock our homes, use as a credit card
I can't wait, I hate carrying Crap around
Merit Egan
Do you actually carry crap around?
Gross
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, in my colon
So do all of its
Tyson Amundsen
What if I wanna give Bryan the keys to my car for a minute but I need to keep my phone
Edward Ekstrom
Us
Tyson Amundsen
How do you solve that conundrum
Edward Ekstrom
You send him a temporary code
Merit Egan
Boom, tempcode
Edward Ekstrom
Everything is easier
You never even have to physically meet up
Merit Egan
My tempcode is 4309485948
Colby Condie

Everyone join my industry and we'll work hard for the next ten years and then we'll party together with our families the rest of our lives

Tyson, we'll write software that does better medical work than all of the doctors combined to scratch your healthcare itch
zach, we'll have so much storage that you can have cameras all over the world filming everything in hd all the time, then you can just edit from midnight to 5a.m. like you already do.
We'll build a little shock machine to shock our nuts and send us into the future like on napoleon dynomyte
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Edward Ekstrom
iRobot II, all of our inventions will gain a mind of their own and try to kill us all.
that will be the next problem we have to solve.

Futuristic hangout right now
Jeff Knudsen
I'm in like Flynn.  What shall I do to prepare?  Hunt a Chupikabra?

Hey guys, my robot just came and asked me why some people live on the sreet. He was visibly sad. Are robots supposed to have emotions?
Uh oh, my robot is holding me hostage until I give all my money to the street people

John Sherwood
Colb leaves tomorrow morn
zach fackrell
If ward ball is a flop and no one shows up me and Bryan are in for friend ball
Colby Condie
I have keys for my church. Do we want to play or not? The church is there
Or if Zach comes we can just use his for ease of planning
Colby Condie
Good call
Bryan Samuelson
Dude sorry guys, but I believe I am a no go for both ward and friend volleyball due to the life ruiner that is physics

Which physics are you guys in? For engineers or normal?
Bryan Samuelson
Normal. Physics for idiots
Tyson Amundsen
Physics is for idiots
Bryan Samuelson
Correct
John Sherwood
Except for Isaac Newton and Liz Newton
Bryan Samuelson
2 people. In the history of physics
Edward Ekstrom
YOu should have taken physics for scientists and engineers.  In that one you use calculus and don't have to memorize as many formulas.
Jeff Knudsen
you should have said no - T Swift
Edward Ekstrom
That's what my professor said anyway.  Maybe he was just trying to make us feel better for taking physics over the summer.
Brayden Haws
Physics is dumb. I'll vow I'll never think about it again after thus class
Edward Ekstrom
have you guys seen glyce?

We skipped school to go see DMB and told her I was going to my grandmas funeral. But eddy forgot to email her so when we got back we said eddy was my step brother and had gone with me
John Sherwood
I vaguely remember that
Edward Ekstrom
Hilarious
#premissionlies
Brayden Haws
Then she would always spell things wrong on the board and we would correct her
Thus the U is not renowned for English
Bryan Samuelson
And then you guys came back and wore marching shirts. That was funny

The correct answer was matching

Tyson Amundsen
Edward did you see/hear bout Ted Cruz and Mike Lee in the senate today? Or anyone for that matter? Politics with Teezer
All things wholesome and Utahn, coming at you live
Brayden Haws
Obamacare
I don't want it
Tyson Amundsen
No level headed person should. Cruz single handedly put the spotlight on the issue for tons who wouldn't already be keyed in on it. Also Mike Lee is from Utah, leading the charge #UtahMan
Brayden Haws
My clinic is considering going to cash only because the payouts from government sponsored insurance pools won't be high enough
Tyson Amundsen
Precisely. Not enough ppl know that the congressmen put an exemption in the law so that they will be exempt from obamacare. Why would they do that? Cuz they don't wanna get screwed over
Brayden Haws
Exactly. Everyone's that's pushing for it to go thru will never have to experience it, or the numerous chain reactions it'll have
Tyson Amundsen
Furthermore, the demos haven't passed a budget in like 5 years, even tho the law says they have to. They keep doing 'continuous resolutions' to keep spending what they are currently doing, cuz they know any budget talks will mean they have to be accountable to vote to cut things, which they hate. Meaning national debt will continue to skyrocketing
Minus the -ing
Plus a #fiscalIrresponsibility
Thursday, September 26, 2013 9:45 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Sorry, I had notifications off. Yeah, I read about the business happening in Washington. I think the republicans are trying to push Obama care off for another year, right?
And democrats want higher debt ceiling?
Merit Egan
Faggots all of em. Except the good ones
Brayden Haws
The whole concept is flawed, just because everyone has health insurance doesn't mean everyone will get good or any health care. A lot of clinics are gonna switch to cash pay only, so basically you have to pay for your visit at that time and the send the bill to your insurance, which likely with the obamacare sponsored plans won't cover it all, so they're stuck with the bill. Or clinics will refuse to accept the insurances.
They've had to change the med license laws and policies because not enough American educators doctors are going to treat obamacare patients. So now the government is allowing foreign nationals who went to med school in other countries to take the med licensing exam here without going to med school because there's gonna be such a need for doctors. And basically those foreign providers will work in govt run clinics seeing obamacare pts. So I mean they'll encounter language barriers and different standards of care
Tyson Amundsen
All correct, and all of which is a major concern to us all. In all, it represents a huge over-reach of government into an area where they have no legal power nor status. what will happen is it tons of money will get dumped into this and instead of that money getting recycled and put back out into people that it is intended for the money will get lost in bureaucracy and administration and inefficient government policies
Edward Ekstrom
And the male Democrats will all make out with each other.
Which is possibly the most disturbing part.
Jeff Knudsen
I'm running for Senate.  All for one, and one for the crew! Vote for me, and your wildest dreams will come true, and your taxes will be cut, and we will all get hawaiian punch in our drinking fountains.  Thank yhou
Edward Ekstrom
I'll make sure there's a chicken in every pot, and a car in every garage.
What us president made that promise?
Brayden Haws
If I'm elected senator I'll make sure everyone gets a personal trainer so they can have the beach body they always dreamed of
Edward Ekstrom
Herbert Hoover was what we were looking for.
Bonus question: what actually happened during his term?
Brayden Haws
Great Depression
The widespread of ghettos called "Hoovervilles"
Edward Ekstrom
The great stock market crash of 1929 which LEAD TO the great depression
And the great depression
itself
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly guys, exactly. In comparison to the god-inspired constitution of the US of A, the average Latin American country had 6 constitutions between 1800-1900

To get those prices I've checked with season ticket holders and KSL and stuff
Brayden Haws
I have work, thus I can't attend or play in the game
Both opportunities I would have taken if offered

For free
John Sherwood
Ill pay an HOA fee
Tyson Amundsen
I'll provide medical care, and ski lessons and soccer coaching for our kids. Also, we can put my kids in charge of snow removal in the winter. Give those whipper-snappers some character
Brayden Haws
I'll own our friendship gym and train all out kids to be warriors

I'll be the neighborhood godfather and patriarch. I'll give advice and counsel to all who seek.

I'll make the grid so whenever we want to get off the mountain, we can just go into our computers.  We'll never have to physically leave the mountain but we'll be able to have awesome travels in virtual world
And I'll eliminate all documents and keys.  All we will ever have to have on us are our smart phones.  No driver licenses, credit cards, passports, or anything physical.  EVERYTHING. ON. OUR. PHONES. PERIOD.

In other news, a perfect sports weekend from the soccer perspective would be an RSL victory, a tie between Seattle and NYRB, and a tie between LA and Portland.

Merit Egan
Quick bbq with the keldogs family in wj, then party. Dont wait up for me. I have no ETA

Brayden Haws
630? 7?
zach fackrell
K we're going to get panda right now. I'm headed to teezerz. Bryan? Eddy?
Bryan Samuelson
I have to do some chores and such so I'm a no go for panda but yes for the game afterwards
John Sherwood
This is probably the best game colb could've ever gone to
Merit Egan
Its real good, especially with my short armpits
John Sherwood
I missed that one. Not sure I understand
Merit Egan
Jeff's comment above. ETA
Jeff Knudsen

John Sherwood
I see.. I didn't see jefes commentary
Edward Ekstrom
zach and teez  can't come

I'm hanging out with my dad until I go get annie from the women's conference
Saturday, September 28, 2013 9:31 PM
Colby Condie

Guys that was THE BEST regular season game I've ever seen. Ever
I have no voice.
Merit Egan
Did you see my picture of you on tv?
Colby Condie
And that green hair Joker guy... I met him today. Funny guy. Well more crazy than anything.
That Gameday pic i tried sending like 10 hours ago.. I guess it just barely sent
i was surprised to see so many voxer notifications
Merit Egan
When can everyone do a video call? I want 80% attendance.
zach fackrell
Great call
Bryan Samuelson
Gr8t call
Brayden Haws
Good call
Sunday, September 29, 2013 8:40 AM
Merit Egan
Cool guys just do a call in the middle of the night.
62.5% attendance. Not bad.
Edward Ekstrom
Cool guys
Jeff Knudsen
real cool dudes
Merit Egan
What time do we do our Sunday call?
zach fackrell
We have hourly calls
Sunday, September 29, 2013 10:02 PM
John Sherwood
Is anyone going to the ReAl game Tuesday? Tix are expensive. I think we should have a watch party
Tyson Amundsen
They are expensive, we're looking at $25-$30. I have a moral obligation to be there
Merit Egan
Not going. Im sending my stunt double to the game
Tyson Amundsen
In other news, Bryan and I are seriously considering going to LA for the deep roots I have there, some good Spanish food, a winnable Utah-USC game, a hot party with the Greek row coeds, and two nights stay at our good friend Al's house
John Sherwood
What weekend is it?
Tyson Amundsen
October 26
John Sherwood
Leave the 26?
Leave the 25?
Tyson Amundsen
Nah that's the Saturday of the game. Get away Thursday the 24th if possible or Friday
John Sherwood
If I don't work the 26 and you guys leave Friday. I'll come
Tyson Amundsen
Can you not get it off? It's a month away. Friday is possible, but not preferred
John Sherwood
I probably wouldn't be able to get it off. As you may have seen this year.. I've gone on many a trip. Using double what is allowed at zions. I'm locked in with my schedule the rest of the year. Especially because I'm cruising the Caribbean for fall break.
Using double *vacation days
Colby Condie
Discount double check
Tyson Amundsen
Understood
Monday, September 30, 2013 9:24 AM
Brayden Haws
John, have you gone to institute today/ do they have any snacks?
John Sherwood
I didn't go in yet.. not til the afternoon
Brayden Haws
Alright, I'll do some recon
I don't be have an institute class, I just take their treats and use their internet
#mormonlife
John Sherwood
Report your findings
Colby Condie
It's ok Haws you're married. #wholesome
Brayden Haws
We've got nachos at the tute today
#fiesta
John Sherwood
Ah yea. How does everyone feel about volleyball Wednesday?
Or we could switch it up with some scatterball or indoor?
Colby Condie
I'd be down. However Jaclyn will be in the MTC by then and Minni will be in st George.
Brayden Haws
Kasey has school but for once I can likely play, school work pending
Colby Condie
Haws will play
Merit Egan
I think I like that idea
Brayden Haws
Pocket dial
Colby Condie
Me thinks me likes it too
Haws, "a butt dial is not the same as a booty call."
Brayden Haws
My phone was in my front pocket so you figure out how it dialed
#10incher
#pocketpool
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Merit Egan
Haws wins comment of the day and it's only noon.
Jeff Knudsen
This doesn't please me
Merit Egan
Jeff he's married. it's ok now.
Edward Ekstrom

Pictures from a haunted house in candaa
Tyson Amundsen
Is that legal from them to publish? It's funny man
Edward Ekstrom
Apparently in canada it is.
zach fackrell
Guys Jed gets home from Africa that day. (Wed) so maybe we can play volleyball. He'll pretty much be a black boy
John Sherwood
Holy crap. I like that.
Merit Egan
hi everahboooooodyyyysssss
Edward Ekstrom
Group call?
Merit Egan
Obvi
John Sherwood
Yup it's happening
Merit Egan
Uh oh
Jeff Knudsen
This is happening
Edward Ekstrom
What?
Book club. Annie and I started Dracula today. You guys should read it with us.
Jeff Knudsen
Video call, you missed it, crucial mistake
Brayden Haws
When was the call? It just barely said it was happening on mine but I pushed answer and nothing happened
Jeff Knudsen
Haws, because of that, I am shopping at Harmon's now
Tuesday, October 1, 2013 5:15 AM
zach fackrell
If I video called right now would you be mad? #sorry
Edward Ekstrom
Haha you crazy Zach
#InsomniZach
Who's going to read Dracula with us.
John Sherwood
I might ed. Who wrote it?
Also tonight for the game.. for those who aren't going.. we are having a watch RSL party at my house. RSLTID
Edward Ekstrom
This Welch guy. Forgot the authors name
Bram Stoker
Irish
Tyson Amundsen
John are you sure its on TV? The tv rights to the Open cup are way Jewish
John Sherwood
Oh dang.. that would be a travesty. Let me research
Edward Ekstrom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2S_UOHlueY&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Merit Egan
Booooooooooooo
Creepy foot doctor
Edward Ekstrom
I'm having ice cream for lunch
And I'm putting it on ritz crackers
ayooooo
Colby Condie
Married life
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, once you're married you poop ice cream and ritz crackers and get to eat them.
Merit Egan
Even if that were true I wouldn't want to do that
Colby Condie
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zebvFBNZ3Mg&sns=em
zach fackrell
So John can we watch at your house?
John Sherwood
Actually we don't have the channel so we're going to buffalo wild wings
zach fackrell
Perfecto
Edward Ekstrom
Wish I didn't have a project due tonight.
Merit Egan
Project smoject.
Edward Ekstrom
Seriously

Does she still show up on you guys Facebook too?
Merit Egan
No, mccall doesnt show up on mine
Edward Ekstrom
Annie
We tried deleting her account like 3 times
Facebook it's possessed
zach fackrell
Yep I found her on FB.
Currently relationship status: engaged.... But it doesn't say to who+-(m)
Edward Ekstrom
Also, what will the church's response to this be?
http://fox13now.com/2013/08/30/group-of-mormon-feminists-push-to-be-part-of-priesthood-meeting-at-general-conference/
http://fox13now.com/2013/08/30/group-of-mormon-feminists-push-to-be-part-of-priesthood-meeting-at-general-conference/
http://ordainwomen.org
Brayden Haws
I was just reading that, idk, I bet they'll let them in
Tyson Amundsen
The church has already said they won't. This is old news man
Brayden Haws
This article is from today. I feel like the church putting it on tv has given them ground to say they should be allowed to attend
Tyson Amundsen
The church has said they won't let them in already. Ordainwomen know that and accept it but are gonna show up to it anyway to prove they are "willing to accept the responsibilities of the priesthood"
I'll post it in a sec when I can
Edward Ekstrom
Okay
Merit Egan
I hate girls. Can I go to the relief society meeting? Please? Who gives a crap. They can read it in the ensign if they want the message. Now they can watch it on tv.
John Sherwood
I want to wear a skirt.
Brayden Haws
Lets all wear skirts to church
And bonnets
John Sherwood
And churn butter for priesthood and fhe
Merit Egan
Nobody has an idea what equality means. Equality deals with common rights, not all this other crap.
Tyson Amundsen
http://m.deseretnews.com/article/865586996/LDS-Church-responds-to-priesthood-meeting-request-by-activists.html?pg=all?ref=http://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-verizon&source=android-home&site=webhp&source=hp&ei=EyhLUt6vKMjnqAHs44G4Dg&q=lds+church+ordain+women&oq=lds+church+ordain+women&gs_l=mobile-gws-hp.12...523411.533218.0.534196.33.29.4.2.2.0.588.10065.2-12j12j1j4.29.0.ekp...0...1.1.27.mobile-gws-hp..7.26.7342.0rEp5MIZvp8
Oh F. Why was that so long
Brayden Haws
I feel like their whole premise is so flawed. Either the church is wrong for not letting women have the priesthood, so it's not true, so why would they want the priesthood anyways? Or if the church gives them the priesthood just because they want it, it's doing mans' will and not gods will and therefore isn't true
Tyson Amundsen
Butter churning #funnyjohn
Colby Condie
Well said Haws
Tyson Amundsen
But yeah, they are a bunch of kooks. I feel like this is a flaxen cord of the adversary that will lead them to greater chains. It's amazing how they can be decieved like this. The article alludes to them basically saying they are gonna tell the prophet to go pray about it
Colby Condie
Guys Zions Bank offered me a job. Just had the interview. All I did was mention John and Kelli then do a striptease and they offered me a job on the spot.
Merit Egan
Guys I want to go to the nursery, but they wont let me. And even when I get in, they won't let me go on the slide.
Also, this is not the same as when the priesthood was only available to white people. That was not doctrinally based. Priesthood being given to men is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven. Also, feminists are stupid.
Question, whats the policy on transvestites?
Edward Ekstrom
I want to give birth to kids. If I wait long enough heavenly father well grant my wish
Merit Egan
Lets go tell the prophet to pray about that. "Prophet, please pray that God will bless me with baby birthing abilities."
Tyson Amundsen
Great comments, all.
Also, 2 hours til the Open Cup!!!! #12hrstilthefiestabowl
Colby Condie
#RSLTID

#ChurchOfRSL
Tyson Amundsen
Good heavens. Not near proactive enough with our possesion in attack. One shot one goal for DC. We'll see what we're made of this half
John Sherwood
This is exactly how the Monterrey game went
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan, start turning your clothes inside out #believe
John Sherwood
Hmm
Merit Egan
i listened on the radio. RSL always disappoints me in these big games
Bryan Samuelson
That was poor
Merit Egan
i still believe. MLS CUP!!!
Tyson Amundsen
Merit you are completely right.
This is the worst I've felt in a long time, maybe ever
I'm not crying. It's just been raining, on my face
What's the strongest drink that I'm allowed to drink?
Brayden Haws
I watched the whole game in Spanish; now it feels like I'm in Tijuana being stabbed in the heart with a rusty spoon
Edward Ekstrom
I have been coding for 5 hours straight
zach fackrell
Mikes hard lemonade mixed with some jones
Merit Egan
Teezer I literally just wayltched that episode of FOTC where they sing that song. I just finished it like 10 minutes ago.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Let's get lit and jump off the roof. And drink that and watch FOTC. And play Feef. And get divine permission to swear as much as we want the rest of the night
Edward Ekstrom
 I'm makin a lasagna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-JOW2YafM&feature=youtube_gdata_player
This will heal you
zach fackrell
I'm watching the hobbit tonight. Everyone that's wants to come join is welcome to
That
Tyson Amundsen
When
Edward Ekstrom
Now!
zach fackrell
I'm about to start it. CST
Colby Condie
Hahahaha yes Eddy. Best song
Officially it's Hermana Condie. She leaves tomorrow bretheren
Bryan Samuelson
Hot dang. Tell her congratulations and give her a hearty handshake on my behalf
Colby Condie
Will do. Any last advice for her you can place here and I will relay it. #middleman
Wednesday, October 2, 2013 8:42 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Tell her, "don't take no sh** from anyone."  And, "don't take no prisoners."
Colby Condie
Haha
Anyone have their mission reunion this Friday? Mine's in Orem
Tyson Amundsen
I kinda do. I may not go tho
Brayden Haws
I don't, my mission sucks, we never do
Edward Ekstrom
To give all the missionaries filet minon like they are used to in haws' mission would be too expensive
That's why they don't have any.
Since all we eat is dirt and bugs at my reunion, we have one every conference.
Brayden Haws
That's true eddy, if they didn't have lobster I wouldn't even go
Served on gold plates
John Sherwood
Is volleyball in the chips tonight? Jed gets home right z?
Colby Condie
Yeah if they didn't serve hand made lasagna and gelato shipped direct from Italy I wouldn't go to my reunion either
Brayden Haws
Is anyone going to Todd's thing on friday?
Colby Condie
If he pays me back my $400 I would go
Jk
Edward Ekstrom
what $400
Colby Condie
Me Todd and Jared each lost $400 while doing a brief security system selling gig.
Todd made an honest mistake and we lost money. Happens
Edward Ekstrom
Oh yeah.  What did he forget to do?
Colby Condie
Just offered the customers a lot of free stuff and we never got paid back
Brayden Haws
Todd forgot you're supposed to sell things for money, not for smiles
Colby Condie
Then haws began to train Jared in the art of powerlifting so Jared could beat up Todd. But then Jared went on a mission
Tyson Amundsen
This would've been enough material to make a whole season for our Xcerpt television series
Controversy, money, anger, training... Good stuff
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Furn Gully
Merit Egan
I would love an xcerpt tv series.
Episode 1: The Right of Passage
I'll turn it over to someone for the story line, but that is the title of the first ep
Jeff Knudsen
The story line will consist of how each of our friends joined the "original" crew
Edward Ekstrom
You have to do more bench reps than jeffs mom
I still havent passed yet
Jeff Knudsen

zach fackrell
Just woke up. Jed gets home in like 2 hours!! Ayoooo scuz.
We all need to go on a over nighter up the canyon now that he's back.

And eat nutrient hash like last time
Brayden Haws
Nutrient Water! You're drinking you!
Eddy I'll train you, but you aren't allowed to abandon me for religious reasons like Jared did
Edward Ekstrom
Okay
Merit Egan
Haha the infamous bench press competition
Edward Ekstrom
I have more money saved up right now than Warren Buffet did at age 23.
Edward Ekstrom
But by 25 he had $100,000..
John Sherwood
What did he have at 23?
Edward Ekstrom
$6,000
John Sherwood
I've got not as much as warren by the time I'm 23.
But that didn't stop warren buffet. Look at him now. He's kick A
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Merit Egan
I did have more until utah state robbed me of thousands.
Edward Ekstrom
Sucks
Edward Ekstrom
When is all of y
alls fall break?
John Sherwood
The U has the 14-18 off
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
USU has the 23rd to 25th, and I will also be on a cruise
John Sherwood
Ya Josh and I and 3 others are going to the Caribbean! West side. East side. South side.
Bryan Samuelson
Seafarers of catan. In a related story, are we volleying tonight?
John Sherwood
I don't think ju and I can unfortunately. Dang
Edward Ekstrom
Let's watch Mona Lisa Smile instead.
Just kidding, that would be gay.
Merit Egan
I think I am out for vball as well. had a 5am morning, and have school early tomorrow too
Bryan Samuelson
Understandable. This way it will just be that much sweeter the next time we play cuz we had to wait for it
A penny saved is a penny earned
Edward Ekstrom
Silver lining, nice Bryan
Merit Egan
nice bsam. Once the utah jazz get on the court, I think we need to have bball vball nights. Quick vball, watch some bball, or vice versa
Bryan Samuelson
Great idea Mert. I'm wholeheartedly in favor
We could even play basketball too
Teh trifecta
Or watch volleyball
Merit Egan
men's volleyball. ahhhhhhh eayh
those sculpted mid thighs
Tyson Amundsen
On a more immediate note, we can always play Feefa due to the lack of volleyballers. Haws come down
Merit Egan
we should fully initiate Fifa Friday
every friday
always at the same time
8:30pm CST, which is also MST
Colby Condie
I endorse all previous statements heretofore mentioned.
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
I replied in CST

Bryan Samuelson

Colb I just flew over Italy

Tyson Amundsen
Nachos man. I'll be there ay 3
Edward Ekstrom
Did they always have food at the tute everyday?
Brayden Haws
They're doing great with food this semester
I feel like usually by now the food does out but they're keeping it going
Also merit your moms doppelgänger works at in the Exercise Science Department, I see her like everyday
Merit Egan
She's everywhere, behave yourselves
Edward Ekstrom
Obama is such a hippocrite.
reading political news on the pot helps me to push it out
because of all of the anger, the poop comes out like a dream
Tyson Amundsen
There is wisdom, to be sure
Edward Ekstrom
He acts like all of the problems are because of the republicans
takes no credit for anything that goes wrong
All he cares about is appearance.

Edward Ekstrom

Colby Condie
Yeah what is even going on at Todd's?
I didn't know anything about it
Tyson Amundsen
well consider this your invitation. Cortnee is throwing a surprise party at her parent's place. toddler arrive at 630 so that will be the surprise time, but if you come after that is fine
there should be dinner as well as Utah State BYU
Colby Condie

I feel a costume BNDR coming again to see who reclaims this puppy....
Current and first champion is Mr. Sherwood
Bryan Samuelson

zach fackrell
I'm going to my mission reunion.
Let's play vball tonight night
Merit Egan
Im considering my reunion tonight. I'd also play vball. And I think I'm going to Todd's. BYU v USU is high on my list. WHatever I do, I'd like access to that.
Colby Condie
Merit and Zach where are your reunions? I'm going to mine as well but it's in Orem.
Merit Egan
Mine is in Draper. I'm reluctant, as now there are 2 years of missionaries home that I don't even know.
zach fackrell
Mines in Provo..
Colby Condie
Carpool Z?
Merit Egan
It's World War Z
Carpool Z would be a funny movie though. Coming this May, what happens when a mom, driving the kids to school, has a zombie outbreak in the captain seats?
Tyson Amundsen
Guys we have real creativity here. Merit, don't go to your reunion. You know you'll regret it
Merit Egan
Can a zombie unbuckle a seat belt, or will that keep the other kids safe?
Brayden Haws
Tyson we're going to Todd's want us to pick you up? You're like the son we never had
Edward Ekstrom
you forgot the? Merit.the real story is it keeps happening over and over again and nobody knows if its real because of the? Comes the mushroom because of the city with the third level of your dream of conception
Brayden Haws
Or a cool cousin or something
Edward Ekstrom
Inception*
Tyson Amundsen
No I'll take the son label. For those who don't know BTW, Haws first kid will be Al Teezer Haws.
And yeah man let's go together
Merit Egan
dream of conception...haha
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Only the non married people on here have those
Merit Egan
i want to say something funny, but I have nothin
absolutely nothin
stupid school turning my brain into a non creative, conforming member of society
Brayden Haws
Do you wanna arrive for the surprise? I'm good just getting there at like 7 when Todd does
Edward Ekstrom
school ruins fun and comedy
Brayden Haws
Tell Seth to come
And al
Edward Ekstrom
4 minutes
To the weekend
Ayoooooooo
zach fackrell
I'm driving down with non creative mission friends.
But I'll be back tonight.

Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
I just assumed it would be eddy taking a picture in the stall
Edward Ekstrom
colby you are changing jobs agin?
Colby Condie
Well I got the job by taking my pants off so why should it be different when I start working?
Yeah eddy the RSL store slows way down offseason so I'm basically not working there no more
Tyson Amundsen
Colby, its time you got your patriarchal blessing from merit. Then you will have real direction in your life
Edward Ekstrom
Got it
Colby Condie
I like my jobs like I like my women: high paying and quick
Brayden Haws
Tyson's right, merit told me to get married so I did
Edward Ekstrom
Colby's had more jobs than googles had searches

I didn't even want to but he said I had to

Tyson Amundsen
Correct me if I'm wrong, but john didn't merits uncle have you tell your conversion story to him, and he was going to give it to Neil L. Andersen? Aka do u know if it will be in conference? #mormonlife #ldsconf
John Sherwood
I don't think it will be. Wynn would've emailed me to tell me I think
Fingers crossed though
Tyson Amundsen
Agreed. That would really be something, its for sure worthy of it so we'll see
Merit Egan
Very interesting. I have not heard
zach fackrell
I submitted the friendship quiz john sent us on the mission. That's worthy of a conference talk too
John Sherwood
"Let brother love continue" HEB 13:1

Colby Condie
Bryan's GoogleHangout profile pic looks like he'll be giving a talk of his own in conference this weekend.

Jeff Knudsen
Finch, Smart and gang want to play a sport.  Anyone in for vball, bball, or indoor soccer?
zach fackrell

Jeff Knudsen

Brayden Haws
If we play in salt lake
Jeff Knudsen

Brayden Haws
Exactly
Tyson Amundsen
Nah Haws stay there, let's play N64 Live
Goldeneye? Wave Race?
Colby Condie
I am having pizza at my uncles house
Then a bit of HW after this.... Unfortunate
Brayden Haws
Tyson that sounds doable, if we tie a
Shoelace wrapped in tin foil from my house to yours we should be able to system link
Tyson Amundsen
Colorado beating Seattle 4-0? The church is true

Edward Ekstrom
What do you think those women are thinking after all off these talks
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Fool of a took. #gandalf
Merit Egan
This article talks about it, but this kelly person is the founder if Ordain Women. Her comments at the end make me even more annoyed at their whole thing
Brayden Haws
Why would she say that? That's just further disproving the validity of their cause. At least as far as going to priesthood season
Session
Edward Ekstrom
So weird
Bryan Samuelson
Is Chris wingers mormon? He tweeted about watching conference
Wingert*
Colby Condie
Interesting. I have no idea. Teezr?
Brayden Haws
He's got a hot girlfriend
Colby Condie
Modest girls are the hottest girls
Or is it immodest girls?
Tyson Amundsen
I just read the tweet, he said he watched with Chelsie Hightower? Zach knows her, idk if she is Mormon
He is not to my knowledge
zach fackrell

Bryan Samuelson
We've got cookies at the institute. They're in the classrooms though
Jeff Knudsen
Piece of cake
Colby Condie
To whom it may concern (mainly Merit and Teezr) :

Walking Dead starts again this Sunday. Watch party?
Tyson Amundsen
I love the walking dead, but I'm conflicted
Merit Egan
I'll be walking dead if I'm not there.
Colby Condie
Haha good
Teezr is it the same conflict as last season?

Monday, October 7, 2013 7:09 PM
Tyson Amundsen
on behalf of myself, Haas, and Bryan, a big thank you to John Sherwood for the charitable use of his physics knowledge
John Sherwood
A gracious shout out on keeping my mind keen. Also I think the institute is closed.... yet I'm in it
Bryan Samuelson
There's a special place in the in the institute for a benevolent physics mind. Where only you can go
Brayden Haws
Guys hey guys just went shopping for like two hours, didn't have my phone, I missed you guys, I was worried you would find a new haws to replace me while I was gone
Tyson Amundsen
I was just thinking, we need to hire someone to do our moneyball stats. I'm interested in our voxes/day, per week, per month as a group. I'm also interested in individual stats
Merit Egan
Merit has added new Haws to the group.
Googlestics (Google Statistics)
Tyson contributes 9 voxes per day, with an average word count of 7.
Monday, October 7, 2013 11:01 PM
Bryan Samuelson
Sports are dumb. I don't even like sports. Sports are stupid and dumb
Colby Condie
I'm going to hide in a hole
Tyson Amundsen
That's not true Bryan. Also colb, I still have the same walking dead conflicts I had back then #delayedvoxes
Colby Condie
See you guys in Spring
I'm gonna hide in a hole
John Sherwood
I needed that win guys. I was having a poor day once you guys left my house. Thus brightened it slightly
Bryan Samuelson
What made your day poor? I don't like that. I like that even less than I like the Braves losing
Edward Ekstrom
I'm pooping
Video call?
John Sherwood
Just frustration of hard math and the most absurd church meeting I've ever been a part of. I'm in the "mingles" committee and we had a 90 minute meeting (outside 830-10) for the stupidest mingle idea this Sunday.
Edward Ekstrom
Wow
John Sherwood
Stupid reasons but still not a fun night
Edward Ekstrom
That sucks
John Sherwood
90 minutes!!
Bryan Samuelson
Well that's dumb. In other news, I really don't like it when the Braves lose
Edward Ekstrom
I'm mad because Google fiber isn't here yet
I'm also mad because I'm taking six classes and 3 of them have huge programs due every week
Bryan Samuelson
We can all be mad together
Edward Ekstrom
But I'm happy because my phone's screen is so big
John Sherwood
Ya let's all be mad. Bring the demons outta me
Edward Ekstrom
I'm also not mad because in about ten minutes I get to go to bed with my wife.
Bryan Samuelson
Well that's something I simply can't share with you
Thus unity is broken
Edward Ekstrom
I'm sorry
Bryan Samuelson
Great, no I'm just mad all by myself
Edward Ekstrom
Haws and merit! Married people unite!
They are probably in bed with their wives and can't attend to my calls
Merit Egan
I unite.
Also eddy, you forgot the quotes. You meant to say "go to bed"
Also, john that is an insanely absurd meeting. Outside in the frostybair, meetings can last no longer than 20 minutes.
Bryan, im sorry about your baseball news. I can't relate because baseball.
Im mad because I have school at 8am
But the jazz have a preseason gake tomorrow. Are you joking me?
6 straight #now7
zach fackrell
#sorrynotsorry
Jeff Knudsen
A gake?  Is that a game while eating cake?
Bryan Samuelson
Thanks to the caring words of our patriarch, my anger has now calmed. Slightly. I like the Jazz
Merit Egan
Bad call
Now im mad
Jeff Knudsen
kapeesh kapoosh
Bryan Samuelson
Guys I'm so mad about that call
zach fackrell
The worst call
Jeff Knudsen
I'm not happy until Reuben returns
Bryan Samuelson
Oh Jeff thanks for reminding me..... This guy I worked with today was in Jared's mission! He went on splits with him a few times!
Brayden Haws
I bought a couch that turns into a bed just so Jared can live in my house
Jeff Knudsen
I adopted Jared and he is now my son
Merit Egan
Guys, we need a call with all of us. Do we need ro schedule a call for the future?
October 14th?
Brayden Haws
Did he say Jared was a bad ah mofo who must had an awesome personal trainer?
Guys usually you do calls when I'm T work (not the case today) or when I'm ready scrips/talking to my woman (case tonight) but I would love to call
Bryan Samuelson
Those were his exact words Haws. Uncanny
Brayden Haws
But did he actually say ruby was doing good?
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah. Well like he's been home for a while, but he said Jared was a cool guy, that he liked cars and bikes and stuff
Colby Condie
3 years in a row the Braves lose in heartbreaking fashion.. I'm very depressed right now
And pissed
Excuse my French
Tuesday, October 8, 2013 8:29 AM
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
I just wake up to 3 new voxes.

Merit Egan
It was joyous to wake up to 3 new googlevoxes
Edward Ekstrom
Good.

Jeff, why are you throwing a big fish in your picture?
Jeff Knudsen
I don't have any other pictures.  Am I supposed to pick a profesh one?

Merit Egan changed the topic to Canzzzzzzzzzzzerrssss
Merit Egan

Tyson, please explain
Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to Canzerzz Heimerzz
Edward Ekstrom
There we go
Merit Egan
Ahhhh, I feel much better
Jeff Knudsen
Someone tell me the name of our chat
right meow
Bryan Samuelson
Canzerzz heimerzz
Merit Egan
Haha
Bsam for the win
Tyson Amundsen
Dating back to 2007, the Canzerzz Heimerzz as an institution was founded in M. Daniel Egan's basement in a response to the boom of rock band, which was popular at the time
Jeff Knudsen
understood
Brayden Haws
This group is legendary for their unrelenting spirit which they used to overcome the neverending Setlist
Edward Ekstrom
Legend states that the group played for 100 straight eating and drinking nothing but molca burritos, bk rodeos, and Arizona mangos.
100 hours
Colby Condie
And only took breaks to play Showtime and Borg
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha bk rodeos. I haven't had one of those in all these many years
Merit Egan
Folklore holds that women tempted these devout men, and even tried to quit the setlist at one point. However, the boys were firm in their task, and were not swayed by the devious tools of the devil.
Edward Ekstrom
At a press conference that week, Deron Williams stated "I'm not a religious guy, but even I'm paying for those Canzerzz boys."
Brayden Haws
Merit I'm eating some zots
Merit Egan
Haha gross. The zot crush was epic.
Brayden Haws
They're like tamacco, I don't even like em but I keep eating them
Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie
What Curt Schilling stuff
#bloodysock
Tyson Amundsen
Weiner
Edward Ekstrom
I don't get how he is getting sued for everything he has?
That means his video game company was a sole proprietorship or a partnership.
John Sherwood
I'm lost
Schilling?
Colby Condie
He's being sued for millions
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah
He started a video game company
took out a loan
the company went bankrupt
and somehow he is getting sued for everything he owns
but usually a company is a separate entity legally
so people can sue your company for everything but not you personally
unless its like a ma and pa shop
zach fackrell
Just read all about it.
His bloody sock sold for $92,613
Edward Ekstrom
Annie and I are coming up to Salt Lake tonight.  Anything going on/
John Sherwood

9 o clock?
I have a racquetball match at 7. I could maybe do 8:30 depending on when it finishes
Whit and Brent may come depending on what time we play. When should we play?
Merit Egan
i'd prefer no later than 9
I've got early school and would like to be home by 10:30ish
8:45?
Colby Condie
8:45 sounds good. But if I finish early, be ready at a minutes notice and we can start earlier
I'll bring the volleyballs
John Sherwood

Merit Egan
8:45
Colby Condie
84:5
John Sherwood
I've got me ju Justin and Scottie at 845

Merit Egan
Maybe he had us sing world's greatest. I think that was it
John Sherwood
I actually liked that assembly
Remember at brookwood when we had that assembly with a singing group.. and they sung about a catwalk or something? Blast from the past. I bet Jeff remembers
Edward Ekstrom
I remember
That was so weird
and they sang about spock
from start treck

A new car lasts years, that victory lasts a week.
Jeff Knudsen

Sunday, October 13, 2013 3:45 PM
Brayden Haws
Eddy we are on 17 red alert, our crazy English teacher is in my ward
I can't face her after our lies
Tyson Amundsen

Big Papi sure had a huge game tonight
Grand slam in the 8th to tie the game
Tyson Amundsen
Yep, I would've done the same
Merit Egan
Anyone watch the walking dead? Not a very good season premiere.
Colby Condie
Haven't seen it yet. Recorded it
Teez when are we watching it?
Merit Egan
We'll initiate talking dead after you watch it.
Tyson Amundsen
Did it open tonight? I had no idea. What's going on with their marketing
Condor I haven't decided not to watch it, but I don't know that I'm going to
Merit Egan
Started back up tonight. Very disappointed in the events that transpired.
Tyson Amundsen
I wonder if I could predict it. I'll start with this- I bet the governor doesn't appear in it and we have no idea where he is. How did Rick and co. end up last time?
I'll guarantee Carl is still a blithering idiot
Merit Egan
I mean the storyline is going fine, just some stupid shiz happened. And of course carl is still the worst. Long hair now.
Colby Condie
I may have lost my walking dead partner in crime: Tyson

Eddy she's there, I'm gonna have to face my sins
Jeff Knudsen
For Haws, "how blessed the day when the lamb and the lion shall lie down together without an ire"
Tyson Amundsen
Edwin, I'll be watching the original Dracula movie tonight at fhe. Does that count?
Jeff Knudsen
Count?  Like Count Dracula? MWAHAHAHA
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, there must be some sort of statute of limitations on our freshmen sins.  Wait until then to confess, then all will be right.  Tyson, that does not count.
Good call.

Brayden Haws
Best way to get your taxes back, don't pay em in the first place

Stick it to the man
Edward Ekstrom
Best way to get your taxes back is don't work and get an obama phone and free housing and food.

We may not have said "come watch drillbit", it might gave just been an invite to hang out
Brayden Haws
No one did, I woulda been there
Edward Ekstrom
If I lived in Sandy, I would have invited you haws.
In fact, I would have invited you, your wife and all those you hold dear.
Merit Egan
I have a "managing organizations and people" midterm in 14 minutes. Anyone an expert on that?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, if someone back-talks you, call them names.
That's the best management style.
Always make inappropriate comments at work, too.
That will get you places.
Make sexist jokes, talk about your salary, and complain about customers behind their backs to all of your employees.
Merit Egan
Anything else? Question 1 asks, if a black person comes to interview, make them wait an extra 30 minutes to ensure they don't erupt in rage. T or F.

Merit Egan
That's what computers are good for. Zach's funny video finding.

Its humorous
But people are so obsessed with it that it makes it less funny to me

Tiny tits #whoacolby
Cmon keep it G rated
Tyson Amundsen
guys I'm going to impart some wisdom . Never be president or in charge of anything. People stop answering your phone calls cause I think you're going to ask them to do things.
I=they
I'm 0 for 7 on the night
Colby Condie
Teezr I will always answer your call
Tyson Amundsen
Nevermind the fact that it turns out i am calling most of them to get them to do things
Bryan where are you
Why are you running and hiding Bryan
Also anyone up for RSL watch party tomo night vs chivas?
Bryan Samuelson
I hate physics. I don't want to do it
Colby Condie
Bryan whenever I don't want to do something, I quit. It makes it all better
Bryan Samuelson
Absolutely
Edward Ekstrom
Physics is easy Bryan.  Physics without calculus is hard.
Tyson Amundsen
Fiddling on the roof #sluttymusicals
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Wednesday, October 23, 2013 9:35 AM
Brayden Haws
John, there is no food at the tute, there will however be a piñata later on. Also it appears to be some kind of earth day here as half the lights are turned off
Tyson Amundsen
There will be ice cream later, to my understanding. Welcome back john, I haven't personally welcomed you yet
Brayden Haws
Tyson I just physics voxed you, my phone was in the graveyard last night but it appears to be revived
John Sherwood
Thank you thank you my heart sings. I will eat ice cream 9 times out of 10
Jeff Knudsen
John, I am glad you have decided to "return to base, Return To Base, ReTuRn To BaSe, RETURN TO BASE!!!!"

Colby Condie
Goooood mornin
Tyson Amundsen
I'll be honest Haws, the only thing that kept me going last night was @bsamtown. Positive attitude, good advice, cheery disposition. Full marks
Bryan Samuelson
Haha thank you Teezer. Good Morneyyyin Canzerzz
Edward Ekstrom
Welome the miss valid victorian
Brayden Haws
That's great man, I just saw your tweets, without a phone it's not a valid way to communicate I learned
Colby Condie
If anyone is interested in going to the RSL game tonight: speak now.
Brayden Haws
Eddy most the apps on my phone won't open. It keeps going back to the lock screen, what should I do? Besides get a new phone
Tyson Amundsen
Kobe brings up an important point. And by that we mean we can probably get us some tickets for free if we arrange it
Jeff Knudsen
Ray comes up with a winning idea, maybe we should go look in the basement
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly. Well we both have surplus punches on our passes, therefore we can go as a crew
John Sherwood
Darn. I'm not able to go tonight. School fiscals and then indoor futbol match.
Edward Ekstrom
Has, did you drop it or get it wet?
If you didn't do any hardware damage, I would reinstall the operating system.
That will fix it if it's a software problem
Jeff, have you gone out with my step cousin yet?
Brayden Haws
No I didn't drop it or anything, it's been running slow for a few days and then last night it just stopped working
Tyson Amundsen
John you play? Or Julia
John Sherwood
Both
Out in woods cross
Jeff Knudsen
Edward, I did.  Landon Smart and I did a double with her and her friend.  She is like Taylor Anne's twin
Colby Condie
I'm planning on going to Thriller on Saturday night with Minni. Anyone else interested? UofU students get discounted tickets
But I don't have tickets yet and I haven't told Minni yet.
Wednesday, October 23, 2013 4:54 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Cool Jeff, how was it?
Tyson Amundsen

Jeff Knudsen contrubution to society:

I want to be more in debt,  I want to be more in debt ,  I want to be more in debt, WHAT DOES BARACK SAY?
We could totes make a viral youtube video on this
Edward Ekstrom
Haha, Obama is dumb.
Tyson Amundsen
Jeff you made that up? Pure genius
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, did you see the devotional on Tuesday?
Bryan Samuelson
The third floor of the library is closed due to bedbugs? Are you kidding?
Brayden Haws
That can't be real
Bryan Samuelson
Oh it's blocked off, and that's what they told me. We've been sabotaged
Jeff Knudsen
Edward I did not, why?
Edward Ekstrom
It was about that stuff.
Jeff Knudsen
about the fox video?  viral videos?  or the presidents?
Edward Ekstrom
Taxation and the negative effect government is having on the economy
Tyson Amundsen
Is that online anywhere? I'd read that. No hesitation
Thursday, October 24, 2013 8:10 PM
Brayden Haws
Biggest thing that was not discussed at the Fogg wedding: RJ has a new wholesome lady, goodbye to the darkness
Thursday, October 24, 2013 11:26 PM
Tyson Amundsen
She was way below his league in terms of looks in my opinion. Like once again I'm just thinking to myself 'why is he dating her? For what purpose?'
Bryan Samuelson
For what point and purpose? Name the movie
Tyson Amundsen
https://www.youtube.com/embed/77twsRDPa0c
In the wise words of LTV, WHAT THE H*** IS THIS?
Bryan Samuelson
Oh no, I have the same shirt as Tyler Haws. Gotta burn it. There's really no other option
Also, Brighton Backstreet > byu basketball.
Even merit agrees. I just called the ship's phone and asked him
Colby Condie
Bryan that's the same shirt that I have too. Oh geez

New Years 2012/2013. Unplanned

Brayden Haws
1045
Brayden Haws
It would be fun to play some morning ball: basketball or foot, tomo
Or soccer or a homerun derby
Bryan Samuelson
I would play basketball, you bet I would
John Sherwood
I'd play anything. As long as I'm nourishing life long relationships
Jeff Knudsen
How about the Oregon Trail from elementary school?
John Sherwood
You betcha.. as long as no one gets scurvy or something. Eat fruit gentlemen
Bryan Samuelson
Oh I would absolutely play Oregon trail
Brayden Haws
I always get cholera and have to be buried along the way
Colby Condie
I never caulked the wagon, just jammed my oxen head first into the water and drowned
Tyson Amundsen
I always get caught in snowstorms and eventually have to eat my fellow pioneers to survive
Jeff Knudsen
Both of your schools had the rated 'M' version apparently...
Edward Ekstrom
I always hacked the game and turned it into rollercoaster tycoon
Colby Condie
I intentionally started a zombie apocalypse and watched the pioneers attack each other uncontrollably. Oregon zombies
Brayden Haws
What is everyone's plans tonight?
Bryan Samuelson
Partyin, partyin
Colby Condie
Haws and Teezr are the only two without Instagram. Join the ranks gentlemen
Brayden Haws
I have no need, I never take pictures
Tyson Amundsen
I love pictures. I like to be in them. I don't have desire to instagram
zach fackrell
I'm just gonna instagram all night. #myplans
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom
What do you mean she is Meryl?
Tyson Amundsen
*stops making out* "I didn't expect this , do you even like me?"
Edward Ekstrom
She asked?
Or you did?
Brayden Haws
Meryl's the dumbest
Tyson Amundsen
Haws help me
Edward Ekstrom
I'm so confused
Tyson Amundsen
Ed this will have to be explained later for it to make sense
Edward Ekstrom
I doubt that Tyson
Brayden Haws
She comes to Tyson's at 1 am and then is surprised that Tyson made out with her and then has the gall to ask if Tyson likes her
So then he had to lie and say yes, cause what else do you say in that situation
Edward Ekstrom
But you don't like her teez?
Or you kind of do?
Tyson Amundsen
No this is meryl's story
Edward Ekstrom
Okay
Tyson Amundsen
I told you it wouldn't make sense.
I'm going to bed
Edward Ekstrom
When was Marilyn incident?
Tyson Amundsen
Yikes, how long... Spring I think
Brayden Haws

She ain't gonna respect the ncmo he ain't gonna respect her
Edward Ekstrom
Haha

Tyson Amundsen
Good man, good.
Edward Ekstrom
Going well or ncmo?
Tyson Amundsen
No ncmo
Edward Ekstrom
Good
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Bryan did well to tell out about Tyson making out with Meryl so Tyson's parents could hear
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, why are you up?
Brayden Haws
Highlight of the night
Why are you up?
Why is Tyson up?
I'm the party wolf, I don't need to sleep
Edward Ekstrom
I'm up because I'm reading about cs ms vs phd
I think I'll do ms
Tyson Amundsen
Haha exactly Haws. I'm humming for your title
And by humming I mean gunning
Brayden Haws
Id gladly bestow it upon Tyson once I have children, I can't let them think of their father as some hooligan
Tyson Amundsen
When will that be man
Brayden Haws
Hopefully not for a long time
Tyson Amundsen
The missus wants it

Colby Condie

Good morning
Brayden Haws
Merit I got a new phone but you weren't here to cheer me on so I didn't get the galaxy, I've made a huge mistake
John Sherwood
Colb did you sleep in a classroom?
Colby Condie
Haha what gave it away?
John Sherwood
The maps and chalkboard
Colby Condie

Italian flag disguised as a chalkboard
Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie
Hahaha keep em comin
John Sherwood
We need ed bsam zach and Jeffs sleeping arrangements
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan is definitely still asleep. I predict we only get a pic from Zach
John Sherwood
Playing the odds.. although that may spark a picture from everyone now
Tyson Amundsen
Reverse psychology. Now they know that we know that they know that we know
Brayden Haws
I also thought Colby had broken into a school to sleep
John Sherwood
How does one get rid of static electricity without electricity themselves? My shirt is going bezerk with static
Don't I have to touch the blarney stone or something?
Colby Condie
You have to eat tons of broccoli. 10% of the time.. It works EVERY time
Jeff Knudsen

Merit Egan
Sting rays were the highlight. Also, ice cream
John Sherwood
Ya string ray city was exquisite

Crystal water
zach fackrell
Holy!!! Sweeeet picture man!
Edward Ekstrom
Nice.
Brayden Haws
I would like to thank Tyson Amundsen for proving to kasey that she has no choice but to let me grow a beard or the Red Sox will lose
John Sherwood
That's right. Even after the series
Tyson Amundsen
I knew it Haws. Also, everyone please fast and pray for the next 15 minutes that Philly scores on Sporting KC. If KC win this we don't win the Supporters Shield
Brayden Haws
If I'm not allowed to grow it til Easters then retroactively the sox will be cursed
Colby Condie
Now instead of the old "Curse of the Bambino" it's now "Curse of the Party Boar"
Merit Egan
#girlphoto just layin by the pool
Colby Condie
Omg you're so tan!! #girlphrases
Merit Egan
Can anyone tell me what is happening in ute nation? Having missed the last 2 games, I missed Travis Wilson being the big man on campus to people calling for him to be benched.
Bryan Samuelson
Who knows Mert. He hasn't played well in our last 2 games. He hurt his hand, so that is probably part of it. He shouldn't be benched though, our backup isn't good
Merit Egan
Everyone on twitter is calling for manning. Who knows. We just futbol fans and the turf is always greener with the backup qb
Brayden Haws
People just think backup qbs are magically good. They don't need no evidence, they just know they're good
John Sherwood
If they take mannings red shirt off, I think wilsons utah career is done.
Which I don't want
Brayden Haws
Guys I'm scared, I really like joe Kelly but if I say that then kasey will kill me
Bryan Samuelson
Dude it it slips out just tell her you were talking about Kellie Egan. Or Joe Montaynia
Jeff Knudsen
Or Jeff Knudsen
Brayden Haws
What is everyone doing?
Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson
I'm just grading tests right now man, I party hard
Tyson Amundsen
I'm at cornbellys
Haha great pic Haws
Brayden Haws
Tyson you best be with Cruz Azul
Brayden Haws

Why does boozers head look like this?
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not man. I'm with a bunch of ppl
Bryan Samuelson
Dude that's shoe polish. No doubt in my mind
Brayden Haws
Why would he do that?
A joke? Who's he trying to fool?
Halloween costume?
Bryan Samuelson
This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen
Brayden Haws
I have to be honest this is one of the most confusing things I've ever seen
Tyson Amundsen
going to haunted things with people who are funny swearers is the greatest experience you can have
Colby Condie
Haws swears and look at him now. He's kicka**
Brayden Haws
People say it's controversial, I say someone's gotta do it
Sunday, October 27, 2013 10:53 AM

Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Interesting turn of events eddy, that teacher is in my ward and now kasey is her home teacher. We spoke in church yesterday and now she just wants to be our best friend
Talked to us for like ten minutes, said she's gonna remember who I am
I shall also grow a beard tyson, thanks to your 95 theses
Bryan Samuelson
Well done Haws. Also, I would play costume volleyball tomorrow night
Brayden Haws
This hipster couple sits next to me in math and after every example the girl ask the guy if he understands what's going on, like she's smarter than him. I'd flip a bi if I was him
Colby Condie
"Don't trust them. Don't trust them any more than you can throw them."

Nobody owns me.
Zach knows what I'm talking about.
zach fackrell
Ayooooo live your life man
That's rad man
Edward Ekstrom
All of you with Androids will have my app by February of next year.
It will bypass the stupid monthly fee of wifi tethering your data plan.
There is already one on the app store that does that, but ours will be more simple and cool.
And on the second release, it will recognize when your computer is looking for wifi and cant find it.
Then it will turn itself on and your computer will join it automatically.
Colby Condie
Will it be free?
Edward Ekstrom
Nope
free trial then you will see how usefull it is and pay me $5 - $7 dollars for it
Haven't decided yet.
Colby Condie
What's the name gonna be? Name is crucial
Edward Ekstrom
True.  Need to do some customer validation for that.
What do you guys think?
Colby Condie
Something simple but bold. Memorable but short
Edward Ekstrom
Edwiena-big-weina
Colby Condie
Bièiëwng
Tyson Amundsen
Zeezrom I'll be at your house in una hora #cutsbyjudy
Bryan Samuelson

Colby Condie

John: Scott and I are emailing back and forth on Zions email. Ayoo
Eddy I think I might buy multiple Droids just to get your app multiple times
John Sherwood
Ha amazing. And let's say volleyball tomorrow at 830? Sound good to everyone?
Colby Condie
I could do earlier if the group wants too. Depends on Zach and the keys I guess
zach fackrell
Only if all out friends come.

John Sherwood

Brayden Haws

#bringingthebaconandbread
Colby Condie
We'll start at midnight so haws can come
Edward Ekstrom
Stick it to the man
Bryan Samuelson

Tyson Amundsen

and other Halloween jams
Colby Condie
My iHome is unfortunately broken
Tyson Amundsen
ideally we would have some huge speakers, but and I home was what I figured would be most easy and portable. which I do have.
Edward Ekstrom
I'll be there for v ball
Tyson Amundsen
And by that you mean boy who cried wolf or that you will be coming for v ball
Tuesday, October 29, 2013 1:07 AM
Colby Condie
Costume vball. Dress to impress. What time are we playing?
Tuesday, October 29, 2013 7:49 AM
John Sherwood
8 o clock. If you don't dress up, we reserve the right to tape your legs together and you play as a mermaid
No mermaids on my team
Also funny fact, I'm training a kid named Scott Osborne today. I think it's the brighton Scott Osborne
Colby Condie
Haha I bet it is
Also: what are everyone's thoughts on RSL's new sponsor for next year? New jersey sponsor
John Sherwood
It'll be a weird change. Alas I'm open to it
Jeff Knudsen
Why is Colby's new nickname Alas?  Isn't that a woman's name? #AliceInWonderland
Tyson Amundsen
It's a good thing. It's a fairly significant figure of money, and since RSL is a small market team to me it suggests that we might have a new TV deal coming in the next little bit. Because they won't pay that much money to not have their product seen as much.
on a purely aesthetic front, I really like it. Because it is small white and unobtrusive just like xango
Colby Condie
Agreed. I would've liked maybe a different sponsor but the money factor is important. Also, wait til you see the jersey design. It's sweet. I haven't seen it yet but it was described to me
Tyson Amundsen
Dude somehow Blake got it from someone who works there. He showed me a picture, its freakin sweet
Colby Condie
Yeah man it's the bees knees
Sales in the team store will explode
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Happiness across the valley will increase
Marriages will increase
Suicides decline
National debt will be halved
Colby Condie
Everyone will join the Mormon church
Abortion will cease
And everyone will start banking with Zions. #me #john #scott #kelli
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Yes. Most important.
Merit Egan

John Sherwood
8 o clock tonight. Roll call. Me and ju = 2
Merit Egan
Me and kel =4
And im dressing as a two headed monster, so 5?
Colby Condie
Minni and me self: 6
Tyson Amundsen
Me + 1= 8
John Sherwood
Cruz azul Tyson?
Merit Egan
Yes teez who?
Tyson Amundsen

dude guys idk, maybe I should redact that to be just me until further notice . 7
Colby Condie
Tyson invite Baylie Henrie. Blast from past
Bryan Samuelson
I can't come until 8:30. But I'll give a 110% when I arrive
Merit Egan
We all know 8:30 will be our start time. Let's not hide from our inadequacies. #butbeontimestill
Colby Condie
I'm already here
Merit Egan
Haha
Colby Condie
Been here since 8 AM warming up
John Sherwood
8 o clock sharp. Except for bsam
Tyson Amundsen
8 oclock. Colb that's a great idea, she is super pretty. But prob too random at this point
Edward Ekstrom
In meet my match, I couldn't argue my way back into 5 points on my project write up for algorithms...
The professor is a Wiley sob.
Colby Condie
Kick his a** Seabass
Merit Egan
I have the gayest class I've ever taken. Phys 3020, great scientists. It's one of those types of classes you have to take to round out your generals. But it's my most time consuming of all my classes, and I have 5 classes in my degree. Shouldn't those be more work and time consuming than gayness 3020?
John Sherwood
Gayness. For tonight I think there should be a general rule that you cannot dress us as an athlete or sports figure. Too easy
Colby Condie
Which means that "Karla Malone" can't dress up as Karl Malone
John Sherwood
She'll have to be george karla
Bryan Samuelson
Well shi
Tyson Amundsen
I agree with john.
John Sherwood
Tyson are you bringing the ihome?
Colby Condie
I invited Fogg
Zach are you dressing up as Sacajawea?
zach fackrell
Me + Jed
I have a sweet costume
Brayden Haws
Guys I wish I could play
Tyson Amundsen
John should I? We need someone with an iPhone who will play the music. I have a Droid, and my ipod doesn't have monster mash. Weird
Merit Egan
Do iphones still even work?
Brayden Haws
John guess who I saw at the fieldhouse today?
Jeff Knudsen
I want to come! Duh when is this going down?
Brayden Haws
Blast from our math past
John Sherwood
Mikelle featherstone.
Brayden Haws
Not as hot as mikelle but equally cool
John Sherwood
Ms aposhian
Brayden Haws
It's a guy
Jeff Knudsen
me?
Wait, I'm hotter than Mikelle, never mind
Bryan Samuelson
Who all was in that math class where it was just our friends and a bunch of hot women? That was a career highlight
Merit Egan
I was. Jared and eddy and jeff were as well. Haha that was enjoyable. I believe hoser was too.
Colby Condie
Jeff the costume vball is at 8
"8 PM sharp"

-Merit
Jeff Knudsen
sharpe cheese
Bryan Samuelson
Unrelated question: does anyone have an inner tube?
John Sherwood
Who'd you see haas?
Brayden Haws
Justin Andrews

Colby Condie
As I was walking out of work, I found a $1 bill on the ground. Tender mercies. This is why we pay tithing. #staypositive #dailygrind
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly Colb
Merit Egan
#blessed #staypositive #sharethewealth
Colby Condie
Yes everyone who comes tonight (in costume) will get 1/10 of the dollar I found. #sharethewealth #charity #goodsamaritan
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
Almost en route. Eta 8:10.
John Sherwood
En route. Eta: on time
Brayden Haws
Eta 3 hours
Colby Condie
Almost en route.
John Sherwood
2 to 1 odds that haws made it before colb. Takers?
Merit Egan
Give me 3 to 1 and I'll put down the part of that dollar I get from colb.
zach fackrell
I'm 3 seconds away
Tyson Amundsen
En route with I home. And a great costume
Brayden Haws
I'm dressed as Waldo, so I'll be there you guys just likely won't see me
Tyson Amundsen
I'm dressed as a famous fast food mascot.
Merit Egan
I apologize for my lack of effort in costuming. #betterlucknextyear
Also, jeff gledhill and tyler hillam are the worst #schwing
John Sherwood
If gomez was there we could've had the 3 gayest butterflies there ever was
Merit Egan
Haha seriously.
Brayden Haws
What was everyone's costumes?
John Sherwood

Edward Ekstrom
My costume was murder my professor

Brayden Haws
John is the insta winner
Of all halloween a ever
Tyson Amundsen
Guys I wanna watch a scary movie tomo night. I can't let Halloween come and go without having done it
What I'm saying is, if anyone wants to unite then that's great
John Sherwood
A good plan. I don't think julia and I can though. I'd be available Halloween night for that though. I want to view the conjourning
Wednesday, October 30, 2013 7:05 AM
Jeff Knudsen
HAHAHA John that is hilarious!
Colby Condie
Jeff changed his pic. No more fish throwing
Or fish stabbing. I forget which one
Jeff Knudsen
I learned that everyone can see it... I looked to ridiculous or if I were speaking to a Boggart "Ridikulous!!!!"
Colby Condie
#BeatOKC
Merit Egan
Durant, more like dumbant. #cantevencollectfoodforthewinter
Bryan Samuelson
Good Jeff, now you're a classy businessman like me
Tyson Amundsen
Democracy in Latin America. Holy crap. I just had the most terrifying/fascinating lecture I think I've ever had in college, about drug cartels in Mexico and the failures of government there. we got problems, but everywhere else is worse.
and the honest truth is that gospel principles if applied on a basic and fundamental level through families would really solve of all of them
Merit Egan
We have Obama Bin Laden, nowhere is worse.
Bryan Samuelson
I wanna take that class now teezer
Brayden Haws
Teezr has just become dan jones, preaching the Mormon Jesus
Brayden Haws
Jazz party?
Jeff Knudsen
Agreed, prophecies of what will happen here are pretty scary
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, we learned about accounting in my software for business classes today.
Also, I have some info that will help you with your business ideas
Colby Condie
Look at us. We're all just growing up before our own eyes.
Jeff Knudsen
Riddle my mind Edward, riddle me.  I have an idea for you as well... S-Corp named Barcelona Associates
Edward Ekstrom
Haha yes.
I'll have to share it with you in person, this class is awesome
Hasss, Brett Dennen had a new album! ! ! ! !
Wild child is sick
Merit Egan
Its all about FIFO and LIFO #amirightjeff?
Edward Ekstrom
First in first out?  Last in first out?
Merit Egan
he knows
Edward Ekstrom
Those are computer science terms
haha used for queues.
what does that have to do with accounting?
Brayden Haws
John were you recently at institute?
John Sherwood
I was inside at 3. Now I'm parked there and at the library
Brayden Haws
Gotcha I saw you driving that way awhile back, tried to contact, didn't work
Thursday, October 31, 2013 12:26 AM
Jeff Knudsen
When you store inventory you either price it at the price of items that came First in going first out to customers or at the price of items that Last came in which are going first out.  FIFO, LIFO, or a weighted average.  Kapeesh Kapoosh, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
Colby Condie
Your mom goes to college Jeff
Edward Ekstrom
A stack is last in first out. A queue is first in first out, unless it is a priority queue. In that case, the maximum is always first out based on the implicit compare function or an explicit comparator object.
Thursday, October 31, 2013 9:06 AM
Colby Condie
Halloween plans?
Edward Ekstrom
Party.
Tyson Amundsen
Institute party
Edward Ekstrom

Jeff Knudsen

Merit Egan
Try a pun on this one jeff. Texas chainsaw massacre.
Jeff Knudsen
I once heard that happened on one acre of land... then I learned it happened on mas acre.  mas=more.  Acre=land. Mas Acre = more land.  Massacre = death. Jeff = the Punster.
Tyson Amundsen
Free carmel apples at the union. Haws, bsam, Juan I'll see you there
Merit Egan

John Sherwood

Bryan Samuelson
I'm pondering my options as far as inviting a girl. I haven't made any invites yet and I'm not dead-set on it, so if there are two worthy candidates for those tickets that's fine with me
Merit Egan
Ok. I have no one in mind. And its not a big deal if we dont use em. Just post on here pending invites so we dont over promise them.
Currently 0 of 2 pending invites
1 pending with Kelli's sister
Colby Condie

John Sherwood
Are we going to watch the ReAl game tonight?
Collectively
Brayden Haws

Sunday, November 3, 2013 4:31 PM
Bryan Samuelson
I like rsl, I also like haws mansion and got choc and games
Colby Condie
Will RSL be at your house Haws?
Tyson Amundsen
It's not likely I can do a watch party. I have a church duty later, company at my house now, and need to write a 5 pager tonight
zach fackrell

This is a letter I found in my scrips from my mission. #teez
John Sherwood
Poop stains on G's. Hilarity
Tyson Amundsen
Haha oh gosh, wow man great find. I'd forgotten about those poop stains
Merit Egan
Haha good letter
Tyson Amundsen
Not pretty but RSL is getting it done
Merit Egan
Yeah, a few too many chances for LA. But alas RSL is handling themselves on the pitch. Their kits look good.
Tyson Amundsen
Great soccer terminology, I agree. I love how knowledgeable we are. The commentators are in love with schuler but he keeps giving it away
John Sherwood
Ya he's had one saving play and he's The Saving Grace of rsl
Merit Egan
Yeah was that his header in to the ground that nearly handed them a goal?
Tyson Amundsen
Yup. And I can think of at least one other he gave away right down the center of the pitch. We'll need rimando to come up big this half at some point I'm sure
John Sherwood
Wow. What a strike
Merit Egan
I hate LA
Tyson Amundsen
You gotta be kidding me
Merit Egan
Press right a few times, let's go ultra offensive.
Tyson Amundsen
Good subs
We instantly look better
Edward Ekstrom
What round is this
final?
semifinal
quarter?
Heezler, you never told me if you like the new brett dennen
Brayden Haws
Guys, haws #2 here...are you guys mad at me? Like for taking Brayden away or what cuz no one responded to my invitation to come to our home this evening.....
Edward Ekstrom
Hello mrs. lady.
I couldn't come because I live in Provo.
Merit Egan
Haha I responded in person
Tyson Amundsen
I did respond. See previous Google voxes
Merit Egan
If you believe then just stand up on your feet
Bryan Samuelson
Hey Kase, welcome to the google vox. I also responded. I'm not mad at you. But I didn't follow up on my response. Thus I apologize
Edward Ekstrom
haha what a sucker
1 on 1 with the keep
hits it wide
Brayden Haws
Ok ok I see, it is fine then. I forgive you all and better see ya'll another time then. Thank you for letting me participate in this hang out! Kasey out.
Edward Ekstrom

RSL can't lose in the first playoff game
Bryan Samuelson
Man Haws, please answer eddy's question. Then, please convey to Mrs Haws that I appreciate the invitation and look forward to my next visit to Haws mansion
Edward Ekstrom
They've still got it in them.
final set piece?
fuhhhhhhhhh
Oh good, I didn't know it went to salt lake now.
What happens if we score one goal at home?
Bryan Samuelson
Overtime
Edward Ekstrom
What's the projection?
rsl 3-0 at the riot?
That's my projection.
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah they don't do the away goal rule any more, so basically whoever wins next game
Bryan Samuelson
Projection?.....Pain
For LA
Edward Ekstrom
Yeahyerrrrr
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I feel confident. Especially considering how good we looked the last 20. And he fact that somehow Keane is misfiring
Brayden Haws
Eddy I like it man, it's good, I'm sorry for my slacking. I'm sorry RSL lost, however I had it right on my bracket now we just need two at home for the win
Merit Egan
I didnt known they did away with the away goal tie breaker. That bodes well.
Edward Ekstrom
Goodnight friends, may God bless all of you this night to have an invigorating sleep to prepare you for another week of life.
Merit Egan
Monday sucks. Always.

Edward Ekstrom
BYU is so gay.
Annie is the only good thing to ever come out of this university.
Jeff Knudsen
What's you problem, Franklin?
Edward Ekstrom
They are making me take the very very very first CS class this summer to graduate because I didn't take an equivalent class at the U because I tested out of it.
Jeff Knudsen
That's annoying.  Blame Utah
Bryan Samuelson
Boooooooo
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah right.  I blame lame BYU for thinking that they are better than the U.  Well I've got a news flash for them.. They arent.
Here is proof.

The U is harder
Fact.
Jeff, you want to take CS 124 with me this summer.  It will be hilarious and I can help you.
zach fackrell

Jeff Knudsen
Would I learn anything from it?  And shouldn't you be talking to your uncle about this?
Edward Ekstrom
You would learn how to program a bit and maybe you could do a minor after that.  I think it's like 3 or 4 more classes???
My uncle is in the head of IT not CS
Jeff Knudsen
Oh ok.  Well I graduate in June so I don't think it would help to take just one class.  do you graduate june too?
Edward Ekstrom
Is that after spring or summer?
Jeff Knudsen
That is the end of spring term which goes from April-June
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, I might do my last 2 math classes for a math minor in summer though.
Jeff Knudsen
Oh OK.  I don't know if we'll walk together then. Minor detail  punpunpunpunupnp
Edward Ekstrom
If you pay me $3, 000 I'll tutor you for all of the minor classes so you can take them all summer term.
Jeff Knudsen
But I don't want to take them.  You can pay me $3,000 and I'll consult you on business strategy with your apps
Edward Ekstrom
Fine.
Colby Condie
Anyone wanna see Gravity or Captain Phillips tonight in theatre?
Tyson Amundsen
How bout some chicks on the walls in here?!?
Edward Ekstrom
It's like a nerd paradise.
Brayden Haws
Who am gonna build ramps for now Rod?!!!!? Who am I gonna build ramps for??!!??
Edward Ekstrom
It's not my fault you cant keep track of your finances.

John Sherwood
My house at 9 or 930. That neighborhood. It's a good informative movie. Everyone is welcome
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Tyson no offense but I feel like we may have previously discussed this video on this very forum a few weeks ago
Merit Egan
Haha "what did she say?"
Wednesday, November 6, 2013 10:48 AM
Brayden Haws
Just say Bryan on campus, always a pleasure
Bryan Samuelson
Oh heck yeah dude
In other news, I feel like my institute teacher just tried to play wingman for me, that was funny
Brayden Haws
He wants you booming and banging Bryan
Tyson Amundsen
Another reason to love the tute
John Sherwood
Cool talk today in the math lab at 1255. Subject of talk: how to make objects invisible. Should be a slammin time. Pizza afterwards.
I guess not in the math lab. Math building. LCB 221 I think
Tyson Amundsen
Dude that sounds ballin, attend that. I have a class that goes to 110 and after that I'm volunteering. I wish I could
Brayden Haws
John takes notes on that shiz, I have a lab or I'd love to come
Bryan Samuelson
I have to study my face off, or else I also would come
Edward Ekstrom
Remember when I wrote a persuasive essay to make us switch to hangouts.
That was the best idea ever because now voxer asks you to join voxer pro every 5 seconds.
Colby Condie
Seriously. GH is just cleaner and easier too
Merit Egan
I was onboard with you from day 1 big ed. I had made the transition with my brothers already, and found google to be oh so sweet.
Tyson Amundsen
You're live blinds you to the tragic flaw of google vox- the lack of voice txts, which are still utterly hilarious and incredibly useful. Which is why Voxer is still in use by members of X today
Edward Ekstrom
That's why we have video calls
But I agree.
It was a nice part of voxer.
We can still revert when we want a nice voice message.
It was just bad sometimes because you're in a place where you cant have inappropriate things being played out of your phone.

Pennyslot cream
Merit Egan
Teezr, cory tanners sister has hired us to play at her wedding in a few weeks. Will you be there? Do you know his family?
Brayden Haws
I agree with Tyson, voice texts are really the essence of life and they're great because you can access them at your convenience where as with a call you have to be there right then
Merit Egan
Im disappointed that tyson says voxer is still in use, but I haven't received a vox since 9/29. It's 11/6 now. Do you hate me?
Tyson Amundsen
Mert unfortunately I do not know his family and I will not be there. Although I can come if you want, do you need a tambourine player?
also I kept the old Vox alive and was sending messages but no one replied and everyone ridiculed. So now there is a separate system only used by a few brave souls
Brayden Haws
I stand with the Vox. I am not ashamed
Tyson Amundsen
I agree Haws. Both systems have their pluses and minuses. As Winston Churchill said "democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried"
Edward Ekstrom
You can't be in the crew
You don't do anything.
Reply: yes I do. (Pelvic dance)
Jeff, have you heard of the Crocker fellowship?

Tyson Amundsen
John how was that lecture today?
John Sherwood
Cool topic. Dull instructor unfortunately. It could've been cooler. But basically, cloaking objects is impossible unless the object is stationary and the person you're disguising from is stationary as well
And they object is relatively small
Bryan Samuelson
So halo lied to us
Is what you're saying
Tyson Amundsen
Haha bsam for the win. Dang john, I still wish I coulda come
John Sherwood
Halo is set in the distant future where earth is coinhabited with humans and aliens. I'm assuming these aliens brought over heaps of scientific knowledge along with some alien diseases as well. Pluses and minuses
Tyson Amundsen
Haha brilliant
Bryan Samuelson
Haha astute commentary John
Brayden Haws

Did you know lana del ray went to a boarding school when she was 15 because she was already an alcoholic?
Miike Snow's voice also reminds me of flight of the concs.
that's mostly why I like them.
Listen to song for no one and tell me the backup voice doesn't sound like brett when he says "this is a song for no one"
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

My phone and computer died at school, it was terrifying to have no technologies for like two hours

$117 an hour is a lot but still not enough to do that many awesome things.
You still have to work all of the time.
If you have one company that makes you $80,000 a year that's better than any salary.
Because then instead of working, you are doing fun things with your family.
You see.
Merit Egan
I just want a job where I can say, "if you do this, I will eat your face!"

Haws shivers may be closed after but a treat is great. Bryan and I really enjoyed a taco vendor on state street, he had it all. Lengua, Carne asada, al pastor, cabeza, barbacoa, etc. unless we want ice cream.

Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen
Yeah the schedule makers in MLS must be the game makers from hunger games. Retarded
Brayden Haws
I'm Mormon I'd still go
My wife wouldn't like that though
Merit Egan
I went. In my heart. Is that the same concept as committing adultery in the heart?
Tyson Amundsen
Nah man, its just a little sin. Like a white lie. Right?

Tyson Amundsen
No its definitely funny
Brayden Haws
They got a ramp from the top floor and a windmill
And they're giving out pbj's
Tyson Amundsen
True truth- I was integral in the creative process that came up with the mini golf idea. Remember those clubs in the office Bryan?
Brayden Haws
Eddy how come the network at the institute always cause my computer to have an error the first time it tries to connect?
Edward Ekstrom
What is the error?
Brayden Haws
I can't remember, I'll pull up the screen shot I took in a bit. But when I try to connect it causes and error and makes my computer restart and then after that it works fine

Tyson Amundsen
How did everyone play?
Scorecard and statistics?
Bryan Samuelson
Everyone played great man. Merit had like 4 threes in the first half, John had about a thousand points, Sam was the Big dog in the paint, Scotty shut down their best player, Colby and Sean did what they do
We had a great guest appearance from Edwina in the first game, which was a tough loss. However, with the win in the second one we move on
Tyson Amundsen
Excellent work brethren
Brayden Haws
As an emeritus status player, I'm proud to support chronic terror and their great organization
Colby Condie
"Both teams fought hard. Both teams fought hard. We just wanted it more."

-Bryan Samuelson
Bryan Samuelson
Haha absolutely Colb. It's the heart of a champion
Also, important question: who wants in for the Utah basketball game tomorrow? Starts at 8, tickets are free. We went last week and it was a great time, I wanna go back to the well
As an added incentive, there are rumors that Cruz Azul will make her first 'X'cerpt appearance
Colby Condie
This is a great enticement
Tyson Amundsen
Believe the hype. Also a post game bash is in order. Who would want to join? I was thinking a fire to roast weenies and mallows and chat. Location is easy
Roll call: me and chicharito for game and post game

Bryan Samuelson

John Sherwood

Tyson I'm trying to reinvent myself as an emo rocker type so if you could mention that to Cruz Azul
Colby Condie
I can see it Haws. Just lose 100 lbs before tomorrow night and you're set
Bryan Samuelson
Good work inviting Fogg Colb

Edward Ekstrom
I have a project due tonight. How gay is that?
Edward Ekstrom
Also, I had the strangest dream last night. We were all playing risk around a table, & I kept pooping in my pants. Then I would have to go to the bathroom to wash out my garment bottoms, and when I would come back you guys would all get mad at me because I was gone and you were waiting for me to take my turn.
Merit Egan
That was no dream Ed. It was so annoying
Edward Ekstrom
So I want to hear why we lost the first game last night.we're they just better than us do you guys think?
They had a LOT of fat beak points.
Merit Egan
They were very physical and played their zone very well
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah they're a good team. Well organized on both offense and defense. Fast break points was bad though, a lot of that is on me
Edward Ekstrom
No way, they had three guys running on almost all of them.
John, have you taken set theory?
John Sherwood
Like topology?
I haven't done topology which covers it in depth. But foundations covers sets a bit. Number theory covers groups and whatnot
And I've taken those
Edward Ekstrom
I meant graph theory. Sorry.
I'm thinking about taking that as the only elective I need for my minor because I think it will be pretty easy??
John Sherwood
Truthfully, I don't know what that is. It sounds sweet. I like graphs. I medium like theory.
Brayden Haws
Cereal, pbj and choc milk at the tute
Merit Egan
They are always trying to lure you guys in. One day....snap. you're all dead.
Tyson Amundsen
Booyea
Colby Condie
Yeah they just want us all to join their cult
Bryan Samuelson
Always trying to get you to read the Mormon bible. I heard they pray to Joe Smith
Brayden Haws
Did you guys know the Firefox logo is a red panda?

Haha
Tyson Amundsen
I'm at the union doing UFS business. Turns out Friday is the day everyone comes here to play weird castle games. Idk if this is Magic, World of Warcroft, of what. But I do know that contrary to popular belief if you 'hero' your archer that he can actually overpower a mage
Merit Egan
Take a picture of the hapenings please
Tyson Amundsen
The orcs have contractile adipose tissue, which can't spontaneously become cellulose and then reconvert to adipose. That's how if you punch them they can just suck your fist in and shoot it out
By can't I mean can
I'm learning a lot
It's a tough pic merit. They are right by a huge window casting glare everywhere. Zach I need back up
Colby Condie
Zach had also been inactive in this chat. Bring back the group. #rally
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Teezr I've reached a phase where my beard is quite itchy, what kind of tips do you have for me
?
Tyson Amundsen

Of=or
Brayden Haws
Oh yes I did that today
Like on the cheeks can I rub some butter on it or something?
Merit Egan
Butter, yes. Margarine, no.
Edward Ekstrom
Do what we did in jewelry.  Get some of that oil from your nose and schmear it all over your cheeks.
Utah football game tomorrow is going to be sick
Oregon'
Oregon's only loss is against Stanford
And Stanford's only loss is against Utah
That means we've basically already beaten Oregon.

Then we go to sandy for a fire on the cement pad with hot cha or we can go to my house/crawdads and play games like last time, includong pit and guess who friend edition.

Then her husband was real mad but kasey just yelled at him to stay in the car and then we drove the opposite way of all the traffic, and finally a cop spotted us so we thought we were busted but rather than stopping us he waved us on

If the desire is there, my house is open. Im also open to traveling elsewhere.
Colby Condie
Minni is coming to my house right now. She wants to watch the Jazz so we can watch it here or elsewhere.
John Sherwood
Yes
Merit Egan
I'm good with both places. Game starts soon. Where to?
Colby Condie

Merit Egan
I'm in
Kelli is in
John Sherwood
Ju and I. In
Merit Egan
Carpool john?
Colby Condie

Excellent news. We'll be en route momentarily
Colby Condie

John Sherwood

Thus
Merit Egan
Little pig little pig let me come in
Tyson Amundsen

I should be doing physics hw. I'm compromising by looking at funny pics of us on Facebook. Pauz, I love us
In other news, let us consider the Eggnog Eggstravaganza. Normally we do it the weekend finals finish for U/BYU/USU. That would correspond to Dec. 20-21, but my bro gets married in Mesa that weekend.
The alternatives I see are Dec 13-14 or Dec 23 which is Monday after finals week
John Sherwood
Either works for me.
Merit Egan
14th is bad for me. All others are gr8
Bryan Samuelson
The 14th is a no-go indeed
Colby Condie
23rd is bad for me. All others are perfect
Brayden Haws
The 23rd is probably better for the Haws'
Brayden Haws
"Quinten Jammer" -Eddy
A prophecy years in the making just came true
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, what are Jaclyn kings dad's views?
Tyson Amundsen
Jostled. My last check and he was one of the most liberal legislators in the House Of Reps. I also found a ranking somewhere, he was no. 3
That's an interesting Q. Also what's your status for the ganza? We've heard from merit, me, john, Bryan, Haws, and colb. So we lack eddy and Jeff input
Edward Ekstrom
We're in
Now tell me
Tyson Amundsen
I just did, see previous Google vox
Colby Condie
It seems that the 23rd and 14th are the no-go dates.
Tyson Amundsen
From my memory, he likes green energy a lot and environment things, govt healthcare, and changing the way representatives are chosen so that democrats aren't such a minority. He also is for increasing public education spending.
What dates are better eddy
Bry where are you in physics
Bryan Samuelson
Just starting. It's so hard to get yourself to do things you hate
Tyson Amundsen
I know, I need your support. 4 and 6 are hard
Bryan Samuelson
I hate when they're hard
Brayden Haws
That's not what she said
Brayden Haws

3 bones at goodwill, still had the tags on it
Colby Condie
AK-47
Bryan Samuelson
Next Three Days is on TV right now, ayoo
Tyson Amundsen
what did she say #dadquotes

Jaws, what about quinten jammer?
Brayden Haws
The broncos fumbled but then the next play he tackled a guy and recovered a fumble so we got the ball back

Jameson Meiling is winning movember so far
Tyson Amundsen
Cuz of his beard? Its pretty big
Brayden Haws
Yeah and it's really full
Like mines so spotty, how can I compete
Tyson I also have visual conf of Cruz Azul, she's always at the tute, she's Mormon
Tyson Amundsen
Precisely. Although I still think you have x ray vision for being able to tell that from merits picture
Brayden Haws
I walk past her like everyday, she kinda has a Natalie bell look
Tyson Amundsen
Kinda yeah. Did you see her Al friend?
Bryan Samuelson
Higgs are you still at the institute?
Tyson Amundsen
BTown did you go to class this marning
Brayden Haws
I'm currently in math but then I could return to the tute
I didn't see her al friend though
Tyson, is FC Tucson joining the league next season?
Tyson Amundsen
Dang. Not that I know of. I forget the relationship that they have with our SL, I think Tucson is Just in the PDL #madgab
Brayden Haws
I was curious because they are on the preseason schedule, so
I didn't know if it was just because it's in Tucson so they're playing some games or if they were being added to the league
The uta police just ticketed this kid for j walking across the trax, like 700 bones
Merit Egan
Yikes. Lesson learned Monday
Colby Condie
Guys this Vietnamese kid in my badminton class just taught me a new game. It's called K-ball. Anyone heard of it? Tyson you would love it especially
Brayden Haws
Merit great reference I lol'ed
Merit Egan
#1280and97.5
Tyson Amundsen
I don't like K Pop
Haws how do you know how much his ticket was? Did he get it for crossing the tracks?
Brayden Haws
Yeah he walked across the Trax, which I do all the time but unlucky for him this uta police saw him and pulled him over and when the cop was telling him off he was like do you know how much the fine for this is? 700
But I feel like everyone does that so this man was unlucky
Merit Egan
Unfortunate news for Travis Wilson. He has something going on in his brain, he's done for the year and maybe for his career.
Brayden Haws
That is quite the turn of events, getting a concussion may have saved his life
Merit Egan
Yeah seriously. Crazy stuff.

Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Ammon the LAMEanite
Merit Egan
and we weren't even trying to scatter the sheep. we wanted to bring them corn, alfalfa, and other nutritious supplements.
i think haws even had a molca burrito to hand feed to the sheep.
Tyson of course just wanted to kill the sheep and experiment with them.
Tyson Amundsen
I don't deny it. In an interesting corollary, today we did our first ever study with a piglet. Correlating nicely with our no good dirty rotten pig/jazz ticket stealing friend colby
Merit Egan
madam colbzoni
Brayden Haws
I had a burrito not only for the sheep but also for colb
Merit Egan

Jeff Knudsen
Here is the real question... when is the GANZA!?!?
Merit Egan
When is the ganza
Tyson Amundsen
Jeff we never got your input. Dates are 13, 14, or 23. No matter when we do it someone will be gone I think
I can't remember who can't come when
Merit Egan
Votes for the 13th and 23rd. 2 (merit and kelli)
Meaning we can come on those days
Colby Condie
13th foe me
*for
John Sherwood
Any . 2 for ju and I
Brayden Haws
23 for us
Colby Condie
Higgenbottom what do you have on the 13th?
Bryan Samuelson
Either the 13th or 23rd for me as well
Brayden Haws
Possible we can actually do the 13th I think it was the 14th that was bad
Merit Egan
The 13th I think would be ideal. The 23rd is a little close to Christmas, but still works
Colby Condie
Yeah I am an almost definite no-go for the 23rd I have a family party I must attend. So the 13th would be ideal for me
Tyson Amundsen

According to figure 8.1 the best option is Friday the 13th
Especially if Haws are all in.
Brayden Haws
Pull the trigger

While speaking of the upcoming Ganza.. Throwback to last year's Ganza
John Sherwood
Best picture by far
zach fackrell
By far the best picture.
Also 13 is a no go for me.
Let's plan on January 1st..

Colby Condie
Bring back the Ganza stache Teezr
Give Cruz Azul some mistletoe lovin as well
Tyson Amundsen
Haha someone post that video in here
zach fackrell
http://vimeo.com/m/55582294
Colby Condie
A lot of throwback faces in there haha what a great vid Zach.
Was there one from last years Ganza?
zach fackrell
Nah man I never made it. Just posted pics
Edward Ekstrom
Annie and I will make it whenever it is, 23rd would be best. Christmas eve eve! ! !
Jeff Knudsen
I think the eve eve would be best for me as well, but any time will do.
Merit Egan
We can't do it at crawdads on the 23rd right? Would work for me, but is a little more hectic with the holiday right there.
Edward Ekstrom
It's the holidays!  you have to pack as much fun in as your can.
Colby Condie
If it's the 23rd, that's the only date I basically am guaranteed to miss it
Tyson Amundsen
Why? We go later than any family party you could have
Also I'm not guaranteed to be back from AZ til the 23rd afternoon. Which could hamper planning
Colby Condie
The Ganza is an all party event. I would prefer to be there for the setup and entire duration.
Tyson Amundsen
Thou hast rightly said
Edward Ekstrom
It says in the Bible not to miss the Ganza Cobly
So you better skip whatever you have to in order to be their from sun up until sun down
Colby Condie
I have stated my desires and shall say no more.
Jeff Knudsen
Just a question, is there a reason the weekend of the 6th and 7th has been thrown out?
Edward Ekstrom
It's not a thanksgiving ganza jeff.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Jeff Knudsen
Oh sorry i meant in DECEMBER!!!!!
Edward Ekstrom
That is only 8 days after thanksgiving.
Do you realize that?
Le'ts just do it the 22nd
Wait thats sunday
The 21st
Tyson Amundsen
7 and 8 is too early
Jeff Knudsen
and new years is a week after Christmas, and Arbor day is a month past July 4th
Tyson Amundsen
The weekend of 21st I am in AZ for my brothers wedding
Edward Ekstrom
And december 11 is pearl harbor day
Jeff Knudsen
ahha
Edward Ekstrom
Le'ts do it the 24th
to the 25th
all nighter
Colby Condie
Dec 13 is the date that everyone can go. It's perfectly placed in between Christmas and thanksgiving to please all those involved
Edward Ekstrom
The 13th is finals week
Jeff Knudsen
settle down binksy
Edward Ekstrom
That is not a pretty week for any of us.
Colby Condie
And it starts the 12 days of Christmas. Hanukkah
Tyson Amundsen
Not perfectly placed, but it is the best date
Jeff Knudsen
Haws, intervene
Tyson Amundsen
No one studies Friday night
Colby Condie
All the better to party on the 13th
It's a Friday
Tyson Amundsen
It's the only date we can all come
Edward Ekstrom
I do have projects due though
Colby Condie
Finals will be done
Edward Ekstrom

And yes I do study friday night
and saturday night.
Tyson Amundsen
Everybody has problems ed

Tyson Amundsen
Well this is a chance for you to repent
Colby Condie
Horse sh**
Jeff Knudsen
Where is the Patriarch when you need him?
Brayden Haws
Guys off what just happened I got kicked out had to re-enter my password, but now I'm here to settle things
I'm sick and tired of you guys fighting all the time
Tyson Amundsen
Hey there dude
This isn't a fight
Brayden Haws
And whining, why is everyone whining? This is a happy season
Tyson Amundsen
It's weekly planning
Colby Condie
Organized scuffle
Tyson Amundsen
Comp inventory
zach fackrell
Are we fighting?
Brothers please
Jeff Knudsen
shut up zach!
Brayden Haws
I want to have the party whenever Jeff says
He's the best planner
Tyson Amundsen
Cock fighting
Brayden Haws
Also I want Zach to be there
Colby Condie
Six senses date
Tyson Amundsen
Haws what?
Jeff Knudsen
sorry zach, auto correct
Brayden Haws
That's my Christmas wish
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen

Nachoooooo
Edward Ekstrom
All I know is all I know.
And all I know is that we are awesome, and of course I will make it if it's the 13th, but I would prefer the 23rd
And I dare venture to say that colby would make it the 23rd
but would prefer the 13th
And in my humble opinion it is more important that colby and all of you single people be there to get all of your pre-teen sexangst out
So do the 13th
plus, I bet more people will come that day than the 23rd.
But we must of course wait for the patriarch to speak
His word is like the dews being distilled from heaven.
zach fackrell
Bravo eddy bravo. Effective use of pros and cons and appropriate opinionated persuasion.
Edward Ekstrom
Thank you Zacharias.
Colby Condie
I can't wait to hear what Brother Merit has to tell us
Father Merit .. Correction
zach fackrell
Does merit even love us?
Edward Ekstrom
He better read all the way back before he guides us in the ways of righteousness.
Colby Condie
Only way to receive true revelation
zach fackrell
Does he even know our names?
Where do we go when we die?
Colby Condie
Dudes Lonny died a year ago today
zach fackrell
Why does bad planning happen to good people?
Edward Ekstrom
It's like his birthday.
His death birhtday.
zach fackrell
Let's get lit and jump off the roof
Colby Condie
Now you're talkin
Edward Ekstrom
Zach, how was the anti-winter party at josh's
Brayden Haws
Zach, I'm a missionary from the Merit Egan Family Friendship, I'd love to come to your home and answer all your questions and tell you what merit can do for you
zach fackrell
More like "anti-weiner party" so many chicks on the walls
@tyson
Is that a cult? @haws
Eddy the party was funny. Josh just blaring music from his basement and some light mingling upstairs. It was fun @eddy
Edward Ekstrom
Zach, you should have said "anti-weinter" party.
then I would have really laughed at that reply rather than only smile/chuckle.
zach fackrell
Haha even I laughed at that reply .. Weinter
"Don't be saiiid peiterr"
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
We're hiatus
Hilarious
Merit Egan
The Patriarch has returned from his hike of solitude. Brethren, the friendship Lord has spoken. The 13th shall be the day of our party. All are invited to attend the jubilee.
#toofar?
Jeff Knudsen
eh just a little
Colby Condie
No merit. It wasn't enough
zach fackrell
Meh just a smidge
Merit Egan
I will die for my beliefs!
Btw, another revelation was received. As Patriarch, I need 2 counselors. More info to come.
Edward Ekstrom
Me and Haws, it's only natural
I'll preside over the Provo branch and report to you.
Colby Condie
And the secretary will be the next one to be married. Only the patriarch knows this though
Brayden Haws
I fear my swearing may disqualify me
Merit Egan
The 2nd counselor can swear
I also need a treasurer to handle the xcerpt finances
zach fackrell
I only aspire to positions of leadership..
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff
He's an account
Merit Egan
Also, I need 5% of your income. Direct deposit will be fine.
Edward Ekstrom
But then the Provo branch might have too much leadership.
Jeff Knudsen
I would like to vote
Merit Egan
True, we better even it out with an area 30 to manage the Asian population. Naturally, John will assume that position.
We need another area 30 to manage the redhead population. Tyson and bsam are the candidates. No official word yet.
Zach, we also need some xcerpt movies that our representatives will show to people.
zach fackrell
And once we have the organization we'll have to hold general friend conference.
Merit Egan
This is true. The fackrell pool tabernacle seems like a great venue.
Merit Egan changed the topic to The Friends of Xcerpt of Latter Day Excerpters
zach fackrell
The Egan basketball court is a nice overflow. We'll dig tunnels in between the ventures for transportation and safety reasons..
Bryan Samuelson
guys, I've been out of touch for a bit, so I just read for 10 minutes to catch up on the convo. Well done everyone. Funny things were said, problems were solved, camraderie was built
Jeff Knudsen
If we start right, it is easy to go right all the time; but if we start wrong we may go wrong, and it will be a hard matter to get right.- Joesph Smith in the King Follett Discourse (Brother Myers)
Merit Egan
Jeff is officially our historian. Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. Mrs. Burbidge I think.
Colby Condie
If I got a dollar for every post that Tyson makes to the Canyon Springs Ward on Facebook, I'd be a millionaire right now.
Tyson Amundsen
Like Bryan, I have now read and caught up to the present day. Hearts were gladdened, tears were shared, a Vox was shared
Colby Condie
Hahahahaha
Edward Ekstrom
I'm severely disappointed that there is a vox con that we're not all invited to.
Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to Canzerzz
Colby Condie changed the topic to Boomin' and Bangin'
Bryan Samuelson
Eddy?
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah, but eddy?
Guys, its circle tweet time #thingsihate
Bryan Samuelson
Anyone want to BNDR on Thursday?
Tyson Amundsen
I'm all in for BNDR
Thursday night. Jersey Edition
Colby Condie
Baseball jerseys only
Brayden Haws
I have work sadly but I'll send Killswitch in my stead
Colby Condie
Or badminton
Badminton jerseys that is
Merit Egan
Will BNDR interfere with #boycottfunfective? Cause I'm semi serious about that.
Colby Condie
We can show up in our jerseys and throw bowling balls at them. That's just as good as bowling in my mind
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha good merit. I figured we'd stick it to them by having a great time while they get beat like they stole sumthin. Because they did
Merit Egan
We have time for both. 7 o'clock boo fest
Brayden Haws
Guys, ball never lies, fungusfective is going done
Down
I don't even know them and I hate them
Wednesday, November 20, 2013 9:05 AM
Edward Ekstrom
What is boycott funcfective?
Bryan Samuelson
Funfective is the team that complained after we beat them and thus got us disqualified
Edward Ekstrom
So why are you boycotting them?
Bryan Samuelson
Because they're a bunch of bums and we should be playing, not them
Erstwhile, the paparazzi are out at the institute, who knows what that's about
Edward Ekstrom
So they got disqualified for the game they had already lost but not for the season?
Colby Condie
No they called the league manager and complained about our team because Sam didn't play with us in the regular season. So we got disqualified (after blowing them out) and now they are playing tomorrow instead of us
Edward Ekstrom
What! Want be on the roster
Wasn't he
Merit Egan
He was on the roster but never played during the season. The league manager said he could play in the tournament as long as nobody complained. Alas those morins complained that they suck at basketball and are now still in the tournament.
Morons
Edward Ekstrom
That's the lamest thing I've ever heard.
Brayden Haws
Douchebags
Colby Condie
It calls for a boycott
Edward Ekstrom
What are you boycotting?
Colby Condie
Then they can count on us meeting them in the parking lot after the game
Brayden Haws
Merit, Collin is getting his mission call, I had a dream he's going to Raleigh, can you confirm this?
Merit Egan
I also had a dream. Yea, he was walking along a path near the rod of iron, at the end of the path was Raleigh. It is true.
Bryan Samuelson
Who's in for BNDR tomorrow? Roll call
Merit Egan
I'm undecided.
John Sherwood
Ju and I
Colby Condie
I will find out in a few hours if I can come. Most likely though, I'm in.
Merit Egan
I mean its likely for me too.
Tyson Amundsen
What's the estimated start time?
Colby Condie
Bryan are you bringin a chick
Bryan Samuelson
I say 8:00 or 8:30, what say ye? Hopefully colbs. Hopefully
Tyson Amundsen
.
Tyson Amundsen
And what are we doing tonight? Anyone available to party?
Colby Condie
I've got tix to Catching Fire pre-release tonight. Minni has connections.
But only two. Unfortunately.
Tyson Amundsen
You jack a--
Second time in a week
Brayden Haws
What time are you picking me up for the movie Colby?
Merit Egan
he already promised it to me
zach fackrell
Colbyyyyyyyyyy
Tyson Amundsen
So we likely aren't party tonight
All because of colby
Jeff Knudsen
Colby thanks for inviting me to go to the movie, make sure to knock on my door, the doorbell doesn't work.  I'm so excited to see it
Colby Condie
If you had one shot, one opportunity..

While crack ho colby is seeing hunger games right... we might as well see it Friday night right? We are looking into tickets right now. Any takers?
Merit Egan
I cannot. Playin at a wedding. I could if it was a late showing. Post 11.
Bryan Samuelson
I'm interested in hunger games. What time are you thinking John?
John Sherwood
9 at the gateway
Tyson Amundsen
I can't either unless its a later showing. 945 prob earliest
Tyson Amundsen
Also I'm assuming BNDR tomo is a jersey edition?
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah 9:45 is prolly the earliest I could do as well. But don't let me stop you
Also, BNDR will be a jersey edition. 8:30 start time. O come o come 'X'mmanuel
Also, who has the trophy? We need the trophy
Colby Condie
I have the trophy. And Minni has a soccer game at like 7:30. Which means we will be arriving at about 9 to BNDR
Bryan Samuelson
Understood. Come in hot post Soccer
John Sherwood
Oh darn. I will see you guys tomorrow for bowling though. Bndr
Tyson Amundsen
830? Good.

Budweiser, Americas most famous beer, is owned by a Brazilian company #jeopardy #trivialpursuit #wits&wafers

Also how did you learn that?
Tyson Amundsen
#latinamericanstudies
Have you played Haws? It's ballin
Dur you were at my house
Brayden Haws
Interesting according to InBev there headquarters are in Belgium and with other offices in Brazil
Keep the facts coming, all the time, I love facts
Tyson Amundsen
Antarctica, who makes guaraná, merged with the other big Brazil brewery in 1999 to become AmBev. In 2004 AmBev bought Belgian brewery Inter to form InBev. In 2008 they bought Anheuser Busch to become the largest beverage company in the world
zach fackrell
Dudes catching fire was sweet!!!
Just saw it
Spoiler alert: katniss catches on fire
Merit Egan
And dies. Katniss is dead
Brayden Haws
Tyson thanks for that info, online it said that by buying Budweiser InBev now controls 45% of the American beverage market
The best part of being married is that you can walk around with no pants on whenever you want
Tyson Amundsen
I look forward to that
Tyson Amundsen
So is urban dictionary like Wikipedia? Anyone can add and upload words and definitions?
Brayden Haws
Yeah you can add and edit anything
Something we do sometimes is go on the random definitions and read them, they're so funny
Tyson Amundsen
I was inspired by LTV to check it out
Brayden Haws
Bryan hates it then
Bryan Samuelson
Oh that's what LTV is. Yep, he's an idiot
Tyson Amundsen
Haha I'll bring up another topic guaranteed to peeve Bryan- politics
Haws, I read today in the Chrony that ASUU just approved $25,000 of student fees to be spent on putting in electric car charging stations.
I about shipped my pants. Zach you need to teach Sara a lesson, cuz she pushed for it
School government systems are awful. ASUU in no way represents the students and does not take most interests into account. All the I wants is to be put on the cover of a bunch of magazines as one of the top 3 progressive and sustainable universities in the country
I = U
And to take our money and gratify their vain ambitions
Brayden Haws
What the shi? No one at our schools drives electric cars, this isn't Tokyo
Why don't they use that money to pay everyone's athletic fees or get more computers or renovate some of the buildings that haven't been improved since the 70's
zach fackrell
Speaking of Tokyo that you was opening a campus in Korea maybe that's and maybe that's why they want charging stations and tomahotchis at the U
The u
Tyson Amundsen
I'll be honest, I have no clue what you just said Zach. But I chuckled nonetheless
zach fackrell
I tried doing voice to text on my phone and it got it all totally wrong..
Tyson Amundsen
We're in a day and age where technology should never fail us. Not in this country
Brayden Haws
Thanks I'll see using voice text is transitive I can replicate if I'm texting you did or you want to stuff and a lot it will confuse Siri she wanted you stressing other migraines about health or jeans and I think that you mind talking out so let's be weird few that
I hope for jeans was supposed to be elephant orgies which I want to be funny CNET CNET cook really it must've in Vegas

You're right Tyson. But I would feel bad ditching her for the evening however.
Tyson Amundsen
Hogwash. It ludicrous for colby to go get sick by being around her
Or maybe that's the idea, then you can both be sick together?
Jeff what do you think? A BYU perspective #diversity
Brayden Haws
When you're married you're trapped with them when they're sick you're already at their house you can't leave
Merit Egan
Tyson doesn't understand women. If he leaves, there won't be a happy moment in their relationship for weeks. #ifthewomanainthappy
#aintnobodyhappy
Tyson Amundsen
That's wassup Haws
Brayden Haws
I'm at work or id be in the call

Here's my beard as consultation
Colby Condie
I'm driving or I would be in the call too
Bryan Samuelson
Zach?
Zach you come?
Zach you come to BNDR?
zach fackrell
Op sorry guys I've been busy getting stuff in order for Africa. I don't think I'll be able to make it....:(:(:(
Merit Egan
To Africa? Zach you don't need to come to BNDR if it will make so you won't be ready for Africa. #priorities
Brayden Haws
Well if Zach's not going neither am I
zach fackrell
Thanks for understanding guys. Come watch the purge after you're done. #moviepriorities
Tyson Amundsen
That German one??
Merit Egan
congrats to young haws, well done sir
Brayden Haws
Hope he likes eating chili
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
If one of you guys want to pick up the bowling pin it's at my house. I am not at home right now but my mom is and she can give it to you
Colby Condie
Guys I wish I could've come bowling. How was it? Who took home the Golden Pin?
John Sherwood
We missed you colb. Merit set the bar high with a 184. Luckily I had a 207 on the second game taking the golden pin for the night. A riveting gamble game took place in game three as well
Merit Egan
The king is not dethroned tonight.
Colby Condie
207. Pretty dang good. Johns name will remain on the pin. Until next time..
I'm going to St George for the weekend.
Tyson Amundsen
GaaAAAAY #mrchang
Colby Condie
Haha
Merit Egan
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Colby I hate to break it to you, but Minni is in no condition to travel. She could catch cold and die out there on the trail. Maybe even just blow away in the wind. Can't be too careful
Brayden Haws
She could develop cholera or Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Tyson Amundsen
Or even get diarrhea and die of dehydration
Brayden Haws
Gastroenteritis
Collin almost died from
That
Zachary Taylor did in fact die from it
Tyson Amundsen
Lord have mercy
Merit Egan
Haws, don't encourage Tyson. He's being unwholesome
Brayden Haws
Merit I can't help it, I don't know how to be serious
Merit Egan
Touch the tip of your nose with your tongue. Once that is accomplished, you can be serious
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah, we care about colby. And Minni. These things happen. We are right to be concerned
Also I can do that
Brayden Haws
I care about all xcerpters and their compadres
Bryan Samuelson
There is beauty all around, when there's love in the google vox
Jeff Knudsen

Merit Egan
Haha that is the best
I love samsung
Tyson Amundsen
Isn't that an old story? And not true?
Merit Egan
I believe it is fake, but still, samsung would do it if they had all the nickels.
Colby Condie
RSL plays at 7 on Sunday. Huge game. Watch party?
Merit Egan
Accepted
Tyson Amundsen
Yes
Brayden Haws
Of course I'll accept your gambit
Bryan Samuelson
Check yes Juliet
John Sherwood
Aye
Colby Condie
Location? I'll be getting back from St George at around that time. We could do my house potentially. Record it
Tyson Amundsen
That's good. Mine is possible
True/False: When bears hibernate, they shove pine cones and stuff up their butt so they don't duke all over themselves
Colby Condie
True
Along with other leaves and debris
Brayden Haws
That's true
Collin told me that
He's a bear expert
Colby Condie
Guys if you spend $100 at Fanzz they give you two free lower bowl Jazz tix.
Tyson Amundsen
How did everyone know about bears hibernation status?
Brayden Haws
Collins like a bear preacher, you can teach you all about their ways
Tyson Amundsen
Like I said, I rule democracy in Latin America
Brayden Haws
Guys what are we doing tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
I work til like 630. Then open, so maybe Utah game
Brayden Haws
That would be fun. Also I wouldn't mind a poker night
Tyson Amundsen
Haha what an idea
Brayden Haws
I love poker always and forever
Bryan Samuelson
Utah game for me, then various partying afterwards.
Brayden Haws
Insidious 2, at the sugar house dollar
Theatre
Tyson Amundsen
Booyea
#insomnizach
zach fackrell
Dudes are you going?? Movie night?
Bryan Samuelson
Guys, I'm gonna be honest with you: I like movies, I like our friends. I saw insidious 2 a while back. I didn't like it
zach fackrell
We could go see wolverine
Bryan Samuelson
I'd do that. You bet I would
zach fackrell
It's an option
Tyson Amundsen
the two reasons for proving why Bryan did not like insidious was he did not see number one and you did not watch it with us. #tiptoethruthetulips
Brayden Haws
Exactly Tyson, even if it's not as good, which how could it not be? With us it's great
zach fackrell

Teeeeeeeeezzzzzzzz
Just teezin the baby
Tyson Amundsen
Haha dude perfect. Are you in for tonight?
We're currently at Haws mansion
zach fackrell
What's the happs? Insidious?
Bryan Samuelson

Jeff Knudsen
Here at Smith's it is 2.83
Edward Ekstrom
Hey guys, the elementary school sighting was rachel turnbow.
Bryan Samuelson
Haha that's great Ed. Write Jared a letter
Jeff Knudsen
I guessed that in one of my ten guesses.  And she works at the MTC with Landon Smart and I.  WILLOW CREEK!
Merit Egan
If I recall eddy's challenge, jeff just earned 10 bucks

Colby Condie
I just checked the record, Jeff clearly wrote: "Ruth Turnbow" So is it Rachel or Ruth? #conflict #pressure
Merit Egan
Haha very true, rachel was much younger and would have been an impossible guess.
I had an elementary sighting last night. 5,000 to whoever gets it. #obscure #impossible
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, you said Ruth.
John Sherwood
Bryan samuelson at bndr. #accurate #loophole
Merit Egan
It was the Brookwood Librarian. A prestigious position.
At the wedding, one of the caterers asked if I went to brookwood. She's been the librarian for 21 years.
Colby Condie
So she went from a librarian to a wedding caterer. #lucrativecareers
Merit Egan
Entrepreneurial
John Sherwood
What is everyone doing tonight?
Bryan Samuelson
I have no plans after 7
Brayden Haws
Two in a row?
Please don't burn Manning's redshirt
John Sherwood
They won't. That'd be the worst decision of all time
Bryan Samuelson
Jon Halliday just kicked off for us. What is happening
Saturday, November 23, 2013 6:36 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Tonight we're all Dynamics fans #BeatKC
Which of course would mean RSL would host MLS cup
Bryan Samuelson
Knock on wood Teezer
You do it right now
Merit Egan
I already bought my ticket. It was only 15 bucks if you bought it before it was clinched.
Tyson Amundsen
Done. Of course conditional upon us beating Portland
Merit Egan
It's in the upper section, but that's still cool
Bryan Samuelson
Good. I won't have you counting our chickens and blowing this for us. Don't you put that on me Ricky Bobby. Dot you out that on us
Merit Egan
I dont really have a ticket
Hey tyson, where is Landin? I don't see him playing tonight.
Brayden Haws
I knew you were lying merit, you were talking about the ticket in such an odd way
Tyson Amundsen
Merit you juked Haws and Bryan but not me. Impressive none the less.
Landin refuses to play when its this cold. It's like 30 degrees in KC

Merit Egan
Landin don't take no shi from no one

Brayden Haws
I didn't get juked
I hate Landin, he never did nothing right but FIFA loved him
Merit Egan
He was FIFA's golden child
Tyson Amundsen
FIFA tonight? I know I would party. Bryan parties. Who else?
Brayden Haws
I have work but I would after
Brayden Haws
My psych teacher is a genius, he is the nations leading researcher in distracted driving, every state that has no texting and driving campaigns were started by him and he won the Pulitzer Prize. I knew he was way smart all semester but then I just googled him and learned so much

Bryan Samuelson
You're right haws. When you're right you're right
Tyson Amundsen
Let's Feef. At Bryans or Merits. John we need to know where you stand

Brayden Haws

Edward Ekstrom
Nice. Roll rsl tnite.
Brayden Haws
Tyson I would like to congratulate you how how successfully you have been able to create a theme song for yourself
Most people can't do that. It's like when people try to give themselves nicknames, usually they just look like duescebags but you've done it well
Merit Egan
If you believe then just stand up on your feet
Bryan Samuelson
Do we have a location for the watch party?
Edward Ekstrom
My apt.
John Sherwood
Colbs teezers or eddys apt?
Colby Condie
Hey it's Minni, we left a baby bit later than we thought. We are about halfway home.

Edward Ekstrom
Oh, we can't come up tonight.  Annie has work at 6 am

Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
Welcome to our brotherhood, Crawdad
Merit Egan
colb I will buy your least favorite for $10. Unless it is sucky and worth less. I need an RSL jers
Welcome Sir Crawdad
Like I don't want a jr jazz jersey with RSL written on it
Tyson Amundsen
Any advice for Crawdad about Google vox dynamics?
Merit Egan
Get a picture, and don't say anything that you wouldn't want on NBC news if you are running for president in the future
Alex Crawford
Thank you for the warm welcome my friends. My first item of business? I propose baseball Tuesday night if anyone is interested.
Merit Egan
#killl0bama
that's a zero to keep it away from bug brother
Alex Crawford
Thanks for the advice Merit. I value my future in politics so I'll check my eccentricity at the door.
Colby Condie
And be prepared to be bombarded with tons of messages at any given point in the day or night
Merit Egan
Any. Given. Night.
I take it my $10 offer wasn't enough.
$12
Tyson Amundsen
Zach why you no come tonight
zach fackrell
More often than not it'll be at a time when you can't respond.
Oh hey guys
Nice to be here
Brayden Haws
Crawdad, just a heads up, sometimes I swear on here and say rude things about marriage
It's my job to bring balance to the vox
Bryan Samuelson
Whoa we got the Crawdad on here?? Welcome welcome Sabbath Crawdad. We're very pleased to have you on board
Jeff Knudsen
Crawdad, I welcome you with open arms
Colby Condie
Jeff how come you never welcome me with open arms?
Jeff Knudsen
In order to welcome you, you have to have gone somewhere Colby.  You have always been there... always...
Colby Condie

Xango for days
Here's the pic you requested Tyson
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha Colb literally has seven xangos
Tyson Amundsen
Since when have you had all those? I swear I've never seen the Orange and yellow. And you have three reds
Colby Condie
Orange and yellow were player jerseys that never saw action on the field. So they dumped them to us and I got those free. 2 red short sleeve and one long. One white long sleeve and the black Rimando jersey. #prestige
Brayden Haws
The yellow still has a tag, obviously hasn't be debuted
Colby Condie
It will see the light of day when the time is right
Tyson Amundsen
Seven xangoes. Indeed Bryan

Which may be what insidious is like but we don't know cause we still have to see it
Brayden Haws
Everyone rally to insidious

I'm about to embark on a nine hour drive.
To revisit the place of the wedds
I just laughed out loud for so long listening to the true vox.
"He's got your baby."
And spooning cops.
What were you guys, drunk?
How am I supposed to work when I have hilarious things like that to listen to all day?
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha exactly Ed. That is the beauty of the Vox
Brayden Haws
That's the convenience of the true vox, you can listen at your own accord
Tyson Amundsen
Me Zach and Haws all jammed into my old truck and rode to the theater snug as swaddled tots. Which prompted hilarity
That's the glory of the vox
Edward Ekstrom
My next essay will be titled "how true vox and google vox can coexist."
Celebrities read mean tweets.
"I saw Larry King at dinner!  But it might have just been a run of the mill goblin."
"Did you know that if you skinned Larry King & ironed out his leather, you could make enough coats to give 1 to every poor child in America?

Brayden Haws
I would love to exchange gifts
Merit Egan
$250 limit?
Brayden Haws
Oh I was gonna say 1000
Thursday, November 28, 2013 4:13 PM
Colby Condie
If we all spend $1000 on a gift then no one loses money. Everyone gets amazing gifts
High rollin
Merit Egan
How true that is. But more like 20 or 25 limit in real life?
Thats like 300 fifa bucks.
Brayden Haws
2000 pennies
Brayden Haws
Matt McGloin aka Pat McGroin
Brayden Haws
What game were we watching and the kicker wrapped his leg around and kicked the onside with his back foot
John Sherwood
Anyone care to watch monsters university at 830 or so tonight? After thanksgiving cool down. We'll be at Julias house.
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan should have told you the answer Haws, I sure don't know. Wholesome invite Juan, pero no puedo
Bryan Samuelson
That's a great question Haws, but I can't remember who it was. Also, I would gladly come watch Monsters U. If I weren't out of state
Colby Condie
Bryan where are you again
Bryan Samuelson
Cleveland
Brayden Haws
Bryan we must remember, that was the only cool thing a kicker has ever done. John we are currently doing fam stuff or I'd be all in for the show
Merit Egan
I'm in midway, otherwise, monsters u all day. All day!
Tyson Amundsen
Front page of the sports page in the des news today is another example of how weird Bishop Mendenhall is

Brayden Haws
What if that had like a picture of their mom?
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly
Colby Condie
That's retarded
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah dude, if that were me I would have stormed off in a fit of rage
Merit Egan
Haha oh rosco. Never can just be normal.
Alex Crawford
Sounds like some sort of sacrilegious offering to me.
Brayden Haws
Happy birthday to Babinski's Baby
Tyson Amundsen
This is my present to you colby
Colby Condie
Best present I've received today teez
Thanks Heezr. Benvenuccitucci
Friday, November 29, 2013 9:58 AM
John Sherwood

Happy birthday colb
Brayden Haws
John message was fun and educational
Bryan Samuelson
On behalf of the great state of Ohio, I'd like to unite my voice to those wishing Colby the happiest of birthdays
Merit Egan
If we were doing a group call, colby could do that thing where there is a birthday cake and candles in front of him. Happy birthday Colb
Tyson Amundsen
I had cranberry sauce for the first time this thanksgiving. I am not sure I'm converted. What says the Google vox concerning cranberry sauce? Colb your opinion counts as double
Brayden Haws
I like it a lot, especially on like a turkey sandwich
Merit Egan
I also like it a lot. Its a sweet compliment to a savory plate.

John Sherwood
Not a huge fan. I tend to avoid the sauce. Anything going on tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
I appreciate the input. I will try it again in a year and return and report my findings
I think tonight not for me, probably just family fiscals still
Brayden Haws
Unlikely for us too, we have to watch the young children. Stockton has meningitis, all Xcerpters please pray for him, if he doesn't achieve his dream of reaching the NBA and NFL then i won't have a brother to mooch off
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah man will do, Jan has been keeping me updated #prayforthehaws
For the benefit of the X, explain meningitis
Brayden Haws
It's an infection of the protective layers of the spinal cord which causes swelling which can damage the spinal cord and brain
Colby Condie
Tyson in reference to your cranberry sauce: I dislike it. If you're speaking of the one that is shaped exactly like a can of beans then I don't like it
Tyson Amundsen
8 mile is on TV. Only thing I'd rather watch is Underworld #whenyourelivingright
Saturday, November 30, 2013 12:12 PM
Brayden Haws
Al has proposed cards against humanity tonight, I would
Saturday, November 30, 2013 4:59 PM
Brayden Haws
Via Al: we are all welcome to come to his mothers house to party tonight
Bryan Samuelson
Thank you Auburn
Sincerely,
A grateful nation
Sunday, December 1, 2013 3:25 PM
Colby Condie changed the topic to #EggnogGanza
Brayden Haws

Some guy at work just wrote this, he's onto us
Colby Condie
Take him down Haws.
Tyson Amundsen
I know we've already done this, but Al wants a vote recount for the ganza. He has a plane ticket home for two days after the scheduled date. That leaves the 23rd as the only other date, which colby can't attend. And we have no crawdads house
Haws, use your Solomon wisdom and cut this baby in half. we can't please everyone
I feel we still should do it the 13th
And make it 100% official
Merit Egan
Both work for me, but the 13th really does seem like the better option all around. If you cant pick both babies, pick the better one and cut the other in half.
Brayden Haws
I don't support abortion so I can't kill the baby so we need to do the 13th
Tyson Amundsen
Well said everyone, thanks for the input. Write it in your hearts, it'll be the 13th
Colby Condie
I support the decision of our friend patriarch: Merit Egan. His decision has the most weight. I also sustain our counselors and their great efforts. And Tyson is the leader of the Ganza organization. He holds the original eggnog recipe in his home and I stand behind his choice of the 13th
Alex Crawford
Aye aye for the 13th. I pulled the nog lights out of the shed this weekend and had the idea that maybe we could put them on the roof this year. Any opinions. The pitch is shallow but it may add flair.
Colby Condie
We always go for flair.
Tyson Amundsen
Yes we do. The nog lights were fantastic last year. So your house is go Alex? We'll be under control
Brayden Haws
Question unrelated to the nog: we ate at a place that put a thin spread of strawberry jam on kaseys turkey sandwich, which at first I thought was weird but now I love it I do it all the time. What are your opinions on the jam-meat sandwich?
Tyson Amundsen
My initial thought is it can't be a good plan
Merit Egan
Well, turkey and cranberry sandwiches are a dream. With the similarities between jam and cranberry sauce, I have to imagine there would be a good camaraderie with the jam meat sandwich.
Colby Condie
I'm always open to try various sauces, jams, and creams on my meats. I would be open to try it. Could be good. Sounds good
Brayden Haws
My thinking and belief is right in line with merit, thus I love jam meat sandwiches
Colby Condie
Haws also loves to wear jammers in the summer
Merit Egan
I think we should play some kanaki before the ganza.
Brayden Haws
A winning and needed ideA
Tyson Amundsen
It's gonna get real cold this week tho...
Jeff Knudsen
Who is bringing the goal to this year's ganza?
Monday, December 2, 2013 8:51 AM
Jeff Knudsen
Can someone make a facebook page for the ganza?  I have a few peps I can bring but since it is the weekend before finals they would need some advanced notice
Colby Condie
I believe Tyson will be making one very soon. Ganza leader
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I have it under construction. Scheduled for release on Wednesday I imagine
We'll prepare every needful thing
Colby Condie
Do work
Brayden Haws
Tyson that kid is talking to Azul again
Colby Condie
Kick his a** seabass
Jeff Knudsen
Colby, you have a lot of attempted cuss words you have wanted to say lately.  What do you have to say for yourself?
Brayden Haws
They're giving out some kinda candies at the tute
Colby Condie
Haws gave me permission to nearly swear
Jeff Knudsen
I know a therapist if you need to release your feelings
Brayden Haws
I give everyone to swear
Permission to swear
Monday, December 2, 2013 2:12 PM
Colby Condie
What's everyone's plan tonight?
Brayden Haws
Just had a lovely lunch meeting with our good friend Tyson Teezr, what a great way to start the week
Tyson Amundsen
Holesome Haws, absolutely. Colbster I work til 11
Brayden Haws
The gym and then no additional plans
Colby did you see knowshon crying during the national anthem yesterday? I respect that, he's a patriot
Colby Condie
Yeah man I did. He was drippin tears like crazy
He's my favorite.
Brayden Haws
Exactly each tear was just a gallon of water
John Sherwood
The tears didn't make sense to me. I've never seen anything like it. And jazz game tonight
Merit Egan
it was like a faucet inside his eyeball
Colby Condie
It was like two mini faucets out of his eyes
Ha yes merit. Good thinkin. Same thought same time
John Sherwood
Jazz tickets. Row 2!!!
Brayden Haws
Johnny swens
Congrats Juan
Colby Condie
Nice Jean Valjean

Brayden Haws
Eddy I'm teaching kasey about Christmas vacation right now
Merit Egan
Attention google vox, I need seth vance's number. Could someone provide it? A dumb teacher wants a final term paper in hard copy by wednesday and lives in logan. Gonna see if seth could print it for me and deliver it.
Bryan Samuelson
Dumb teachers are dumb. (801) 386-3677
Merit Egan
Appreciated. My request has been sent. I will keep you all posted.
Edward Ekstrom
Nice jaws. John who is Justin?
Colby Condie
Eddy will you be home much during Christmas break?
Brayden Haws
Guys so I bought some tickets to the nutcracker but now we can't use em, so if any of you gents want to but em from me you're welcome. I put em on ksl but I'd rather. Xcerpt enjoy them
Tuesday, December 3, 2013 12:03 PM
Brayden Haws
Guys let me tell you what Collin did last night: he went to the jazz game and sat right behind the players bench and then got to drive a lambo 130 mph
He lives the thug life
Colby Condie
Fillin the thug canteen
Bryan Samuelson
That's great man. How though?
Brayden Haws
His young men's leader took him. Apparently this guy and his brother is like our age started a pest control service and now are just loaded. The guy our age lives off 6200 and drives the lambo
Tuesday, December 3, 2013 5:38 PM
Colby Condie
This morning, Teezr and I saw each other driving to our respective destinations during our commutes. Pleasant surprise to my day
Tyson Amundsen
Colb you appear to be wearing some nice dress clothes or something. Did you have a business meeting?
Colby Condie
Was headed to work man. Zions Bank attire. Dress to impress and nothin less
Jeff Knudsen
Wait, did everyone go back to Voxer?  Also is the 13th official for the ganza? and around what time?
Questionnaire? Yes? I think so?
Brayden Haws
Jeff the voxer is the true way
Brayden Haws
Me and Colby have been discussing fun and fun/classy events for the holiday season for our friendship family: festival of trees, Saturday there is a Xmas music and firework show in sandy, sun there is the wasatch symphony Christmas concert
Plus many more fun and free events
Bryan Samuelson
Great work. I would like to add curling at the Olympic oval to that list. It's not overly festive, but a winter delight nonetheless. I wanna do it
Colby Condie
That would be great Bryan. I sure would do it
Brayden Haws
That's way festive man, the most festive of all
Bryan Samuelson
This pleases me. It's on Monday and Friday nights. We'll do it
Colby Condie
That's real great. Let's plan a date and pull the trigger. For reals
Bryan Samuelson
I agree. I'm a no go this Friday, and next friday is the Ganza, but maybe the 20th? I think a Monday would be tough, at least for me
Brayden Haws
M-Dawg is T-Dawg home?
Tyson Amundsen
I am in for any and all plans
I'm also looking for any trip sponsors to help me get to KC. I have a ticket for $100. Requesting donations for a trip fund that otherwise may not be possible. And anyone that wants to tend sheep on Friday or Sat would also be appreciated
Drew bought 5 tix on Craigslist. I wanna go soooooo bad
Sooooool bad
Baaaad #sheep #RSL
Colby Condie
Tyson the game ticket was 100?
Brayden Haws
I wanna go too
How can I convince my wife to give me that for Xmas?
Tyson Amundsen
Idk man. Drew and Blake have $100 game ticks. Think how fun a road trip that would be. Stay with Julia (my sis in law) family. Party
Colby Condie
Are all 5 of his tickets snatched up?
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not sure. Actually no, cuz I haven't claimed mine yet
He could have 3 open. Tho I know he's trying to move them
I wanna go sooooo bad. $100 for tick, gas would prob be close to $100 a person. X amount for food.
I'm just spit ballin here
Colby Condie
My cousin and his wife live in KC as well. He is going to the game. Huge RSL fan
Tyson Amundsen
I love RSL
Realistically I won't/can't go, but I will never say no
Brayden Haws
I also love RSL
Tyson Amundsen
F me
Colby Condie
Well if you think about how many times we have this opportunity in our lives, it's pretty slim
Tyson Amundsen
True
Colby Condie
Young, wild, and free
Small side note: why the heck is the game at 4PM local KC time?
Tyson Amundsen
Probably some tv shiz
Colby Condie
Or 3PM.. I just know it's like 2 here in Utah
Tyson Amundsen
Or so it will be the warmest time of the day. Which will be like 35 degrees
Colby Condie
True
Tyson Amundsen
They should not have the season this long
It needs to end at thanksgiving
Colby Condie
It will be freezing there
Colby Condie changed the topic to #BeatKansasCity
Brayden Haws
RSL has been playing for almost a years straight
Colby Condie
And people say the mlb season is too long...
Merit Egan
Tdawg is home. Arrived early this afternoon. We have played COD to complete his welcoming.
Tyson Amundsen
Break 'em in
Colby Condie
Attaboy
Now get him tweetin again and he'll be back in no time
Tyson Amundsen
No f words and swears tho. He's past that stage now
Wednesday, December 4, 2013 9:15 AM
Tyson Amundsen
It's officially #bootweather
Bryan Samuelson
I'm on board

Brayden Haws
Just had a campus encounter with John Sherwood, his friendship was like a ray of sunshine cutting thru the cold
John Sherwood
I began sweating because of the radiance higgs emits
Tyson Amundsen
It's my opinion that this guy has a sucky name
Brayden Haws
There's got choc at the tute but it seems kinda salty to me
They're trying to get us our electrolytes
Colby Condie
Haha Patrick Boner
Brayden Haws
Colby the institute had unlimited gimbals
Jeff Knudsen
Tyson, I need to start inviting people to the Extravaganza.  Can you make a invite on facebook today?  If not I can make one and you can just adjust it, but I have some good peeps to bring
Brayden Haws
Is this about a girl Jeff!
It's always about a girl
Tyson Amundsen
Love the enthusiasm Jeff. I'll have it up by this afternoon
Colby Condie
Great Facebook event Teezr
Good call
Tyson Amundsen
Good call. The preliminary Facebook invite has dropped. Full scale inviting can be accomplished tonight
Alex Crawford
Tyson, I will make a pledge to your fund. Don't you worry! And a splendid Facebook page indeed. I think the live nativity Should be brought to pass this year. Every year we tout it and never come through.
Also, EVERYONE! Except perhaps john and Colby as you are employees of the company. Zion's bank is having a photo contest and Megan and I are in the running. Sincere thanks would be in order if you would go to www.zionsbank.com/winter and throw a vote to our picture. You get entered to win cool stuff and the prize if we win is most desirable.
Tyson Amundsen
I did as you asked. I would like a sticker that says "I VOTED"
Alex Crawford
How about a donation to your fund instead? $490 and no more.
Tyson Amundsen
Also let the 'ganza invites roll
We're open for business
Wednesday, December 4, 2013 11:28 PM

Bryan Samuelson
Has anyone seen the World Cup draw for the US? Holy cuss words
John Sherwood
Shiz. No easy games. Ghana always has our number
Brayden Haws
I'm not scared of te Germans, my family is German and I'm not scared of them
Colby Condie
Portugal Ghana and Germany. Wow. If Ghana eliminates US in a third straight World Cup.. I'm gonna freak
Bryan Samuelson
It's about freaking time we beat them
Tyson Amundsen
We have Portugal Ghana and Germany?????????????????
Say it ain't so!!!!!!!!!!!
Haws quick Muslim prayer
Bryan take your clothes off and turn your undies inside out
John begin growth of your Jedi rat tail
Merit, as the patriarchal leader please offer a peace sacrifice at midnight tonight
Dear gosh that's a hard group
John Sherwood
It's begun. We can beat Germany. And Ghana. And tie Portugal. Boom. World champs
Colby Condie
And to think that Portugal is probably our easiest game is scary
John Sherwood
Where are we viewing the ReAl game tomorrow? It's a doozy of a game. One could argue it's the biggest of the year
Bryan Samuelson
You could certainly make that argument. I would love a watch party. Erika is in too
Tyson Amundsen
First things first- USA has the group of legitimate death. I believe at long last its time for us to finally beat Ghana. I believe we can win two games and tie. Or if we win one, tie one, and lose one we can also go thru if other chips fall into place
Brayden Haws
I'm here for RSL, wherever here may be
John Sherwood
Good news. Saving silverman is on tv. It's halfway over. Yet still hilarious. I'm a mime
Colby Condie
I'd be feeling confident if US wins one and ties two. There's so much talent in that group that they will probably all beat each other up.
Figuratively speaking of course
Plans tonight? It's Friday people
Tyson Amundsen
John good man, I wish I could watch it
Tyson Amundsen
Colby, not only is it Friday it is also a post physics test Friday. That means we go hard
Colby Condie
Friday night gentlemen
Tyson Amundsen
Brighton ski resort for ward Christmas party. Then post party party
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan, status report? I'm leaving Brighton soon
Bryan Samuelson
I'm home, I have not started the pupusas yet
Tyson Amundsen

With all of us
Brunswick some ppl

Or I can bring them
Bryan Samuelson
Oh wow. I don't think I can handle other people here. The house is in shambles
Tyson Amundsen
Waaaah
#brattyvox
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha. For serious though. Marianne would not be pleased with me
Tyson Amundsen
Well save some pups for me
Brayden Haws

"BYU student documents attempt to get engaged in 6 months" a great article
John you are absolutely right. I'm open to any and all possiblities. I am currently at work til 1 or 130, whenever my backup arrives to relieve me, then I can do whatever. Who wants to watch?
Everyone needs jerseys, Colby has the spares. We have to do everything in our power. Control the controllables.
Bryan Samuelson
I'm in to watch
Brayden Haws
I am currently on a 3 hour water fast as to prepare myself to lead us in the Muslim prayers
Colby Condie
Have we decided on where to watch?
Bryan Samuelson
I don't believe so. Let's do it. My house is not ideal cuz my brother in law has requested using our TiVo to watch the game with an hour/hour and a half delay. My basement could work if need be. Other options?
John Sherwood
If you want to caravan to my house it's available
Colby Condie
My house is an option as well. We've had good soccer luck here
Brayden Haws
Colb you have a great sports venue, I wouldn't be opposed
Tyson Amundsen
Neither would I. I'm sure we can do my house as well, which has boded well these playoffs. I nominate Haws and merit to pick
Do we have an official roll call?
Me: 2. I have enough spirit I count double
Colby Condie
Me (maybe Minni): 3 (maybe 4)
Brayden Haws
Me and Killswitch
6
John Sherwood
Me and a plus one. 8
Tyson Amundsen
Guys, I has a prompting. This should be done at my house. Start right right end
Colb wear all your jerseys
John Sherwood
I like it.
Merit Egan
I should be there and kelli too both of us
John Sherwood
I'll pick up pizzazz?
Colby Condie
I'd certainly contribute for pizzazz
Brayden Haws
As would we
Tyson Amundsen
My saintly mother will make salad
John Sherwood
The saint Martha prepared our pizzas.. they look goood. Picking Julia up then coming over
Tyson Amundsen

Why not two like the rest of the tournament?
Saturday, December 7, 2013 9:19 PM
Tyson Amundsen
I am absolutely devastated. Deflated. Disappointed. We deserved it.
I'll be on #teezersuicidewatch for a few days #RSLTID
We really played a heckuva game tho!

Merit Egan
haha i just found it and saved it. I didn't think it would work
Colby Condie
That just opened up so many possibilities in Google vox
John Sherwood
Weekdays a gif?
What's*
Brayden Haws
Merit is the hero of the day
Tyson Amundsen
John it stands for Great Incisive Footage
Colby Condie
It means Graphics Interchange Format. It's a sequence of pictures in a short looping video type thing. It's not smooth looking like real video though
You see it a lot with sports plays and such
Brayden Haws

John Sherwood
Veo
Colby Condie
Gaaaaaayyyyyy. Haws how did you post that with the iPhone?
I can't figure it out
Brayden Haws
You just have to save the gif. It won't move if you look in your photo album but when you post it it will

Top three most dangrous countries in Latin America- guesses?
Brayden Haws
Columbia, Brazil, Venezuela
Bryan Samuelson
Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. And Brazil. 4 for three
Brayden Haws
Except Nicaragua instead of Venezuela
Colby Condie
Cuba Brazil Mexico
Tyson Amundsen
Good guesses. According to Claudio,
1. Venezuela
2. Guatemala
3. Mexico
Brayden Haws
Dammit I shoulda stayed on Venezuela
It just sounds dangerous
John Sherwood
Is there a difference between dammit and damn it?
Brayden Haws
I feel like angry old men say dammit
Colby Condie
I would say so. Like dammit is just a exclamation of emotion. Damn it is when you are saying damn to a specific situation or object which would have been heretofore established in the conversation
Brayden Haws
Which since I'm married I now am an angry old man
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Top three most free countries in Latin America?
And most not free country?
Colby Condie
Not free: Cuba, Peru, Columbia
John Sherwood
Suriname seems free.
Colby Condie
Free: Mexico, chile, El Salvador
Tyson Amundsen
Free: Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay. Free means they have free and fair elections and good protection of civil liberties and political rights
Edward Ekstrom
top 3 gayest countries in south america?
brokebackzuela
limpristguay
and homotina
Actually..
1. Argentina
2. Argentina
3. Argentina
I'm sure Zach would agree.
Colby Condie
Pre-Ganza gift exchange?
While making eggnog
Merit Egan
I'll have to order a gift ASAP. Maybe we do a pre nog drawing
Brayden Haws
I've been meaning to ask if merit would randomize and distribute the names
Patriarchal duty
Merit Egan
indeed. Who not in this conversation needs to be included?
Seth
do I include zach? late gift?
Brayden Haws

I would feel comfortable with just the convo
But also we could add al and Seth
The I my drawback of Zach is that whoever he has, has to wait til he gets back
But is that really a drawback
Merit Egan
that's true. mandatory attendance?
Tyson Amundsen
Negative
There's no way I get a gift this week. Too slammed
Merit Egan
we can do it anytime, zach won't be there
Let's do gift exchange post ganz
Colby Condie
Agreed
Tyson Amundsen
By post ganz you mean not on friday?
Brayden Haws
Yeah I say you have to be there if you wanna be in the exchange, let's add al and Seth if it's gonna be after the ganza, we'll do it like the week after it so
Tyson Amundsen
That's a better plan. We need time. Also attention needs to shift towards ganza prep
Colby Condie

I have the two glass jugs and the paper goods I think. I have butcher paper for the lists. I have chimes. Alex has accordion and nog lights.
What we really need are for all wives/girlfriends/ppl to bring treats. And to come as early as possible Friday to make a spare batch and prepare every needful thing

Brayden Haws
I can volunteer my wife as a treat maker
And I'll be there bright and early on Friday
Colby Condie
Tyson do you still have those glass jugs I gave you from two Ganzas ago?
Tyson Amundsen
Yes. Those as well as other items I have are listed above

Brayden Haws
These guys at the gym are just talking about making a hangout. I just wanna tell them how much it'll suck compared to ours
Tyson Amundsen
Haha precisely

Alex Crawford

That's a 5 gallon jug on KSL. She wants $40 but I bet we could get it for $10. That's some serious nog capacity.
Bryan Samuelson
I like where your head's at right now Crawdad
John Sherwood
Obscure sighting of the day.. chase passey
zach fackrell
Hey guys add me in the gift exchange and maybe plan on doing it the week before Christmas. I can send something! Or have the exchange the moment I get back. I could come home early!! Also hello from Africa!!

John Sherwood
It looks sunny. I remember that
Edward Ekstrom
My 6 month long project from work got pushed out in the uk today. Every week 14,000 people will use the code I wrote.
Bryan Samuelson
Dude hey Zach! We love you, we miss you, we like your mustache and your African lifestyle. Also, Eddy you're a hero. Make enough money to send a jet to bring Zach home for a quick Christmas visit
John Sherwood
That's crazy ed. What does the code do? And do you get a penny every time someone uses it? Benjamins
Edward Ekstrom
Well my company has paid me $15,000 so far, I don't get paid for the use of the software since they own it. That's why I'm never going to work for any company but my own soon. I just turned their whole web application into a mobile version because most of their users use is on their device about half the time and it was super ugly and hard to use on a mobile browser
Bryan Samuelson
Good heavens. $15,000 and that's you getting jipped. You're going places
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, for some reason people are just willing to spend a lot of money for software. Hopefully it stays this way forever haha
It well probably dip sometime.
Will
Tyson Amundsen
I agree with bryans last few comments. #bringhimhome
zach fackrell
Dude eddy I should be eating dinner with you right now. But in actuality I'm eating with the owner of the largest road building company here in Sierra Leone. He's Chinese and the owner of china construction or something....


Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha
Zach I'm loving having you live. What time is it there?
zach fackrell
9:00 pm:)
Bryan Samuelson
That's 9 pm tomorrow right?
What's the future like?
zach fackrell
Asian..
Colby Condie
He's naked
And filthy rich
Almost naked
But still filthy rich
Alex Crawford
Oh wow Zach. Nice job, did you ask him to pose or is that his natural habitat? Eddy, wow that's an impressive figure you are putting up. What language do you code in?
Edward Ekstrom
Java, css, html5, javascript are what we use at work.
Css isn't really a language, just makes the pages look pretty.
Brayden Haws
http://bit.ly/18l9cGq
Dammit dammit dammit
Say it ain't so
Colby Condie
Shi fuh
RSL needs to hire Tyson Amundsen as head coach now.
Jeff Knudsen
Colby! Haws! Keep it G-rated
Brayden Haws
I'm sorry Jeff, I couldn't hold it in
Tyson Amundsen
its not your fault Hodge. This loss has affected all of us deeply. I have not let it sink in yet, I will have to come to grips with it tonight. I work a night shift so I will be up all night thinking about it
honestly, things could not get worse.
Brayden Haws
We may as well sign Chelis now and let the madness begin
John Sherwood
Who is next in line for the throne teez? I don't want it to be Andy Williams
Tyson Amundsen
exactly. I would love that.
John that's a tough call. I have not read the articles yet, but it sounds like CJ brown is going to Chicago Fire, assistant coach of ours.
so that leaves one assistant coach named Jeff casar. I would be happy with him. We also will probably look at Robin Frazier who is an assistant with New York and used to be an assistant with us. I have also heard from John Liu that they are considering Eric wynalda
Eric was a national team star in the 90's and one of the best for words we have ever had.
Colby Condie
Make Beckerman a player/coach
Merit Egan
Beckerman player coach. Let's take it to twitter
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think I like that
But I love you guys
Things got worse. I just arrived at work from soccer, forgot my change of cloths. Moral of the story: I'll spend tonight without my G top #uhoh
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Hahahahaha Merit that's the best GIF so far
Funniest episode ever
Merit Egan
I'm disappointed by the lack of gifs posted. Let's pick it up

Brayden Haws
Tyson just go pick one up at my house
Tyson Amundsen
Haws I can't leave work. Tonight the fiery darts of the adversary will surely be beating upon me and tempting me. But beneath my G's there is a man. Beneath the man you find... my... nucleus
Bryan has a change he will bring me in the morning
Of my g's not his, mind you
Colby Condie
Hahahaha Tyson that is quite possible one of your top three google voxes ever. Beneath the Teezr we find..

This just in on KSL, Antarctica is cold ..."Try 135.8 degrees Fahrenheit below zero; that's 93.2 degrees below zero Celsius, which sounds only slightly toastier. Better yet, don't try it. That's so cold scientists say it hurts to breathe. "Thank God, I don't know how exactly it feels," Scambos said. But he said scientists do routinely make naked 100 degree below zero dashes outside in the South Pole, so people can survive that temperature for about three minutes.

Routinely? Must be scientific...
#gettin'friskywithpenguins #majorshrinkage

Edward Ekstrom
I heard about that! Utah dropped to #3 now :(
Jeff Knudsen
#3 in what?
Merit Egan
#3 in coolest schools in utah. BYU is 1, USU is 2
Edward Ekstrom
Collect temp recorded
Coldest
Alex Crawford
Not true. Utah had the 2nd coldest of the contiguous 48 states. Not even close to Russia/Alaska cold.
Edward Ekstrom
Oh, US! Good, so we held our spot
Colby Condie
Fairbanks, Alaska I think is the coldest city on average in the US
Edward Ekstrom
http://www.locksleynet.com/2010/05/27/when-not-to-double-barrel-your-name/

That would suck so bad to live there.
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha that's way too funny Ed
Edward Ekstrom
My favorite is Aikin/Johnson
Bryan Samuelson
Also, Alaska takes home the prize, of course it does.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha those made me lol for sure
Jeff Knudsen
Team, how do you think john Liu feels about these definitions...         loo 2  (l)
n. pl. loos Chiefly British
A toilet.                                   john  (jn)
n. Slang
1. A toilet.
His name is translated Toilet Toilet, technically...
Bryan Samuelson
Fun fact: there's a commercial that goes through saying all these different nicknames for the toilet and at one point "john" is followed directly by "loo". Great stuff
Edward Ekstrom
Poor Toilet Toilet..
Alex Crawford
I wonder if he has realized this himself. If not, once someone mentions it he won't be able to think of anything else when he writes his name.

Creeds wedding reception is like the 28th. You are supposed to RSVP by tomo because I think they are doing dinner or something. colb are you going?

Wednesday, December 11, 2013 9:01 PM
Tyson Amundsen
What do you think about getting a baby Jesus for the 'Ganza? #Ganza13
Maybe courtesy of Bry Regher. or TF
Alex Crawford
I think that's a great idea. How big are we talking? I did just pick up a big kitchen funnel at the store today, a rather fortuitous happenstance.
Tyson Amundsen
how big will the ganza be, is that your question?
Brayden Haws
I think a baby would be great
Tyson Amundsen
I think the Ganza will be as big as it usually is. It always turns out bigger than our expectations, and every single year we rise to meet those expectations. Let's keep it rollin #ganza13
Alex, I realize that's not going to be Megan's favorite thing having a big party at the house. But we are clearly in this to help you prepare and maintain the venue, cleaning the house or whatever be necessary
I feel as tho the Ganza has suddenly snuck up on us, incredibly
Alex Crawford
No worries. I am pro ganza all the way. Megan also knew what she was in for when she accepted the party. So an interesting tidbit I discovered at smiths recently. You can purchase an entire crate of eggs for only a little more than an 18 pack.
Tyson Amundsen
Thats fantastic. My mom bought 4 dozen yesterday to do something nice for me #electlady
We'll need more. The official ganza start time says 8. Most people won't arrive before that. I'll be there early, Haws and I and whoever can get the ingredients and we make a batch at around 6 so we have spare.
The rest of us should also be there early to prepare every needful thing of the lights, etc.
wherever possible
Brayden Haws
Naturally I'll be there ASAP as possible to prepare and do my duties. That is great news about the eggs, we're gonna need a whole lot cause things are gonna be crazy. We may need a triple batch, last year a double wasnt enough
Colby Condie
I say we quadruple last year. Cause people wanted seconds but there wasn't any left
Merit Egan

Also, tell all them partiers to BYON
That's bring your own nog
Tyson Amundsen
We need ppl to save any milk cartons you have. We filled like four or five gallons last year. If we are to make more, we'll have to open the coffers and start early
Colby Condie
Crank em up and jack em out
Brayden Haws
Men and brethren there is a pressing need for treats for this party. Usually Zach is the head of the treat committee, but as he is gone we must work in his stead. If possible please persuade your women folk to bake goods for the souls who will come
Thursday, December 12, 2013 8:15 AM
Tyson Amundsen
Hear hear
John Sherwood
Julia and I are making some tonight. Enough to feed the entire ganz? No.
Colby Condie
Where at John? Minni and I may make some tonight too
Ps. Just got to work
Tyson Amundsen
That's good. You don't need to make enough for everyone as long as multiple ppl pitch in. Many hands make light work
Jeff, I'm officially assigning you to bring mistletoe
Brayden Haws
Teezr in related news I found mistletoe yesterday already
Tyson Amundsen
And by found did you mean that you have it?
Brayden Haws
No I didn't buy it yet, but they do have it at the dollar store
Colby Condie
Haws do they have any Christmas trees at the Dollar Tree? #lastyeartweet #top3hawstweets
John Sherwood
Working with colbster. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me
Colby Condie changed the topic to Eggnog Ganza Eve
Jeff Knudsen
OH, I can bring a mistletoe, alright... I should be there about 9 with the toe if that is OK, I get off work in Provost at 8:15 and will come straight up
Colby Condie

#zions
John Sherwood

Merit Egan
I have one question, Colby, how has your work arrival time been? CST or MST?
Jeff Knudsen
haha
Colby Condie
I was scheduled for 8:45 this morning. So I left my house at 4AM and got here just in time
Tyson Amundsen
Wear your sweater to work day
Jeff skip work. At this rate it will only be me Haws john and crawdad there
Jeff Knudsen
I cannot do that, I apologize. Do you still want me to bring the toe?
Tyson Amundsen
Well I want you to bring something besides yourself. Everyone should pitch in with tangible support
And by that I mean I'm not worried about the intangibles- we definitely have Christmas cheer, funness, smiles, bright countenances, etc.
Bryan Samuelson
My eta is 7:30. I will come earlier if possible.
Brayden Haws
I'll be there all day, I love the ganza, I can't believe it's already here
Tyson you still have the Santa hats and beards?
Tyson Amundsen
I also love it, we're here to party. I'm sure I still have them but I will double check.
Brayden Haws
Good the crowning of the santas is always critical
Bryan Samuelson
Also I can bring cookies or something. Home made of course
Brayden Haws
I'm gonna have kasey j make her cookie dough balls I think
Alex Crawford
Megan is making peppermint popcorn and I've got some chocolate pretzels. I'll also probably bake some brownies.
Brayden Haws
Crawdaddy showing off his domestic skills
I like it
Alex Crawford
I think I'll also make some waffle batter in case people we don't like come.
Tyson Amundsen
Setting the tone
Merit Egan
I apologize for my absence in the convo. I will be there early pearly. Thank you. Merit
Tyson Amundsen
Excellent merit. Eggcellent. Also we haven't broken a 100 attendees on the Facebook group, which we did last year. So if anyone has friends to invite let's keep setting records #gojazz
John Sherwood
Is it socially acceptable to put your address on instagram crawdad? I'm doing some advertising
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha good john. Innovative. Yet considerate
Colby Condie
Teez I'll be there as early as you need me tomorrow
Merit Egan
Kelli and I will be there at 7ish.
Colby Condie
Also, what should Minni and I bring as far as treats are concerned? We can bring bratwurst, steak, or brussel sprouts
Jk of course. We'll probably bring some cookies or something
Tyson Amundsen
Excellent one, good job
Colby Condie
What time will you be at Crawdads Tyson?
For when ye come upon that house, there I will be also.
John Sherwood

Colby Condie
Eggcellent
John Sherwood
Halo legos!
Brayden Haws
Zach has some of those
Alex Crawford
Hey John. That's A-ok. I'll be getting home tomorrow around 3 ish of not sooner. Anyone feel free to come over at that time.
Tyson Amundsen
John eggcellent pics!
Brayden Haws
Crawdaddy, how's the streets looking over there?
Jeff Knudsen
This is some great team eggsecution, eggsactly what I was hoping for this year...
Tyson Amundsen
Crawdad goes to bed before 1030 higginbottom
Brayden Haws
I just wanna know if I need to reserve to hours to shovel tomo
We gave a confirmation from Leonard
#prayforcopenhaver
Tyson Amundsen
Just come with me and we'll take care o'business
Colby Condie
I have minimal things to do tomorrow. As far as errands. Upon my completion, I will be going to Crawdads. Also, if anyone wants to join me for a temple session at the Draper temple in the morning, I would love your company.
Brayden Haws
I have class or I would. I love the Mormons
Friday, December 13, 2013 8:31 AM
Jeff Knudsen
Haws, what's the update on your little brother?  Is he doing OK?
Brayden Haws
Jeffery he is doing great, he's back home and back to normal. In a sad turn if events my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer right before he got sick. So everyone pray for mama haws
Bryan Samuelson
Oh Higgins. Cancer is the worst. She's got my prayers
Merit Egan
And mine. Hope everyone's health recovers.
Jeff Knudsen
"And to others it is given to have faith to heal." - D&C 46:20. Our crew unity and faith is with you and your family, Haws!

Yes it is. Prayers and blessings unto the haws'

I'm just arriving to the temple. Special prayers for the Haws' from the House of The Lord
Tyson Amundsen

John Sherwood

For those without twitter
Merit Egan
Kelli has proposed that we aggressively advertise a hashtag at the ganza, something that anyone who instagrams a picture will use something like #ganza2014
Have a poster at the front, as well as papers throughout the event reminding everyone to use the hashtag
Alex Crawford
Good idea. Just a note, this is the year 2013 a.d.
Merit Egan
haha
oh yeah, I'm gettin ahead of myself. Already in 2014 mode
Alex Crawford
You and Zach are both just one with the future.
Merit Egan
#ganza2014
or #homemadenognight
#eggnog2013
Tyson Amundsen
We've already been active with the hashtag #ganza13
Merit Egan
yes, I've seen it. How do we advertise. let's get this shi% trending
Tyson Amundsen
Most advertising should already have taken place. Use Twitter, instagram, etc. Boost the txt
#bryantheTA
Merit Egan
This is so that when our guests arrive, they will also know to use the hashtag. Thus, all their followers see the fun at the ganza, then they click on the hashtag and see all the pctures
Tyson Amundsen
Oh smart. I'll put the hashtags on the 'please nog' and naughty and nice list
Merit Egan
That's what I'm looking for
Tyson Amundsen
Also who can play the Zach role and take pics? Pictures equate to memories
Like last years Saint Teezer. And all those pics of us making faces in the basement
Jeff Knudsen
Who has a camera?
Merit Egan
My hope would be that I can click on the hashtag and see 50 pictures posted on intagram and twitter
Tyson Amundsen
Great expectations. Love it merit. The camera could be for anyone. Like a fringe friend even

I feel like everyone should go on fb right now and attack Gomez for his stupid post
Colby Condie
Oh geez
I've yet to see it
Brayden Haws
He just ripped into Dave checketts only to be informed that he no longer owns RSL
Merit Egan
haha what an idiot. He argued that Wittingham should be fired last season. He's a moron.
Colby Condie
Haha he knows nothing. He just changed his status to Dell Loy Hansen too. I'm glad Drew commented on it before he changed it
John Sherwood
I missed it.. what did he put on his status?
Brayden Haws
Dear Dell Loy Hansen,
Please resign as owner of Real Salt Lake and get the @!#$ out of my city and state. Due to your stupidity, selfishness, and ego by not re-signing Jason Kreis last year when you had the chance, we have now lost our greatest asset to New York. But hey, you may be right to not have re-signed him...I mean he did only lead us to be the youngest franchise in MLS history to win a championship... So again, please leave, you complete idiot.

Sincerely,
Probably not just me
He had this except it said Dave checketts
Colby Condie
Ya the original status said had Checketts on it. His opinion is clearly void if he doesn't even know who he's talking about
John Sherwood
Ha gomez. Weinie.
Merit Egan
haha how dumb.
Alex Crawford


Today has been a rather interesting commute...
John Sherwood
Haha hilarious sticker. Nice truck
Tyson Amundsen

What time do you want ju and I there
If it soon. We'll be late. If it is 6 or later. We'll be there
Colby Condie
Comin hot
Tyson Amundsen
So me Haws and crawdad are making the preliminary batches. We will make one during the party of course. If you can't come right now then the best time to come is 645 or so and we can rearrange some furniture and hang the naughty and nice list and stuff
Colby Condie

Making nog with style.
Tyson Amundsen
Ok. Bryan, we are officially assigning the mistletoe to you. It shouldn't be hard to get
Bryan Samuelson
Roger that. Dollar tree?
Tyson Amundsen
Or smiths by your work. Wherever really.
Brayden Haws
Also maybe that fresh market by your work
Or dans
Tyson Amundsen
Also 645 appears to be early. 715 or 725 is fine as long as no one is on CST
Bryan Samuelson
I I just got off work. Thus 15 minutes behind schedule. But fear not little flock
We're 0 for 2 on the mistletoe hunt
Tyson Amundsen
What? Inconceivable. Haws where shall he go
You can do it Bryan

I was thinking perhaps going to the game and then temple square
Tyson Amundsen
What a great ganza, enjoyed every minute. Shout out to crawdad for hosting. On the financial aspect, the nog cost us $55 so if anyone wants to toss a few bones my way that would be fine by me
Merit Egan
I'll pay tithing to teez on the nog.

This is how the test went. Q. What is an adiabatic process?
I of course had zero clue the real answer. So I responded as follows
A. Similar to alchemy, an adiabatic process takes useless gases like farts and turns them into perfume

For that one I just wrote some of the elements that were on that huge poster at the front of the auditorium

the google vox has been quiet because of all of your studious work. Why is the U still in school?
It's against the Christmas Law

That's how we lure people in. If I wasn't mormon i'd join just for the pizza. No doubt
Tyson Amundsen
I wish I was there man. For pizza and for fun things
Brayden Haws
Guys we should play roller hockey like the old days, that was bad ah
Edward Ekstrom
Two more finals then I'm done!
Yeayerrrrr
Merit Egan
are we doing a friend gift exchange?
or should we just do a gif exchange?
Jeff Knudsen
I think it would be fun to do a friend exchange.  Like $5 or $10 limit?  I'd be down
Merit Egan
I'd be down. I'd be open for the following limits. $5, $10, $15, $20, $23, $25
Colby Condie
Yes Jeff. $20 limit. We're adults Jeff
Or $25
Merit Egan
whatever is agreed upon is fine
haha
we're adults
Brayden Haws
$23
That's sounds about right to me
Or 21.50

This is happening at school right now
Merit Egan
I assume everyone who is in this convo will participate? (-zeez)
This is how I will determine the gifts. I will now scramble this 5 times
Teezer drew his own name. Unacceptable. Respin.
John Sherwood
Respin
Merit Egan
we have our results
Crawdad buys for BSAM
BSAM buys for Mert Dog
Colbinski Buys for Crawdad
Haws buys for Colbinski
Teezer Buys for Edwina
Jeezy buys for Jefe Grande
Edwina Buys for Teezer
jEFE gRANDE buys for Haws
Mert Dog Buys for Jeezy
any complaints? we can respin... The eddy teezer switcharoo could pose problems
you know, like teezer buys a rolex for eddy, but eddy buys a snickers for teez...
Crawdad > BSAM
BSAM > Mert Dog
Colbinski > Crawdad
Haws > Colbinski
Teezer > Edwina
Jeezy > Jefe Grande
Edwina > Teezer
Jefe Grande > Haws
Mert Dog > Jeezy
Brayden Haws
I think if there's any really nice gifts then we change it to a Yankee swap and let fate decide who gets it
Merit Egan
haha, like on the office.
That's fun
John Sherwood
$25 or less.
Brayden Haws
I will buy for Colby, dinner and ken Griffey jrs house
Jeff Knudsen
Wait did we decide $25? I'd vote $15. That's a lot of money on top of what we are already doing for our family stuff if you all do that too
John Sherwood
$20
Merit Egan
let's say $14-21 (before tax)
John Sherwood
Jeff casser. New head coach rsl
Merit Egan
anywhere in that range is perfectly acceptable
Jeff Knudsen
Will we have a gathering to exchange?
Merit Egan
We should
Jeff Knudsen
Eve of Dec 23?
Merit Egan
Monday the 23rd?
Jeff Knudsen

John Sherwood
I can't do that one. I probably would have to wait til 26th or something
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
I'd be fine doing it like that weekend after Xmas, keep the Christmas spirit going
Merit Egan
that's fine with me
Jeff Knudsen
I can't.  Air mail package if it happens then
Merit Egan
Or everyone could deliver their presents on their own, then we can do a google video call and everyone open it
Jeff Knudsen
haha
Brayden Haws
We need that goodweenie app to figure out a day we can do it

Tyson Amundsen
If I had to choose which would be more likely between Zach getting paid to take pictures on the moon and the Haws being healthy, I'd pick the first
Brayden Haws
I agree Teezr
zach fackrell
Cool Tyson wants me dead
Brayden Haws
I don't want Zach dead, he's an awesome friend and has an awesome coat
zach fackrell
Thanks haws. I left right after you guys.
The worms got restless..

Seth Vance
Church was let out early today due to a small electrical fire in the building. Happy to report that there were no injuries. #thespiritofgod #likeafireisburning
Tyson Amundsen
Are you kidding? I'm quitting the ward. Cool stuff as soon as I leave
Seth Vance
Haha yeah man. It was pretty great.. no one seemed to care that the church was on fire though.. After we knew about it we still sang all verses of joy to the world and had the opening prayer before they dismissed us.
Colby Condie
What really happened though was Seth was making out with a chick in the kitchen... Things got frisky and they knocked over a lamp which sent sparks everywhere. Thus starting the fire
Seth Vance
Why they have lamps in the kitchen, I'll never know...
Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Merit Egan

zach fackrell
Hahah what the amazing
Alex Crawford
Welcome welcome Seth!

Merit Egan
Oh how Venmo has made this a breeze
Colby Condie
So simple
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
So quick
Merit Egan
Colb buys me wendy's, I send him over a couple bucks. too easy
Edward Ekstrom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7oEcVYsea8&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Zach, the first words of this song sound like you.
Ewwwhooohoooo
John Sherwood
Merit, you'd recommend venmo then?
Colby Condie
Hahaha eddy that is exactly like Zach. Perfecto
Edward Ekstrom
Awesome song as well.
Married peeps:  what did you get your wives for Christmas?
Brayden Haws
I bought my wife a tool box and some protein powder. Hopefully she likes it cause I lost the receipt, so if she doesn't I'll just have to use it
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I bought my wife a computer that says "Property of Eddy Ekstrom" on top of it.
I hope she likes it.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
I would recommend Venmo. Quite easy.
I got Kelli a Kindle Paperwhite. Unfortunately she has already opened it and is reading a book. #earlychristmas
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
Now the question arises, do I need to supplement the gift with something small for christmas morning? You just never know.
Brayden Haws
Just toilet paper the whole inside of you apartment merit, making it look like a winter wonderland and then let her clean it up, she'll love that
Colby Condie
Haws knows women
Merit Egan
hahah what an idea
Or I should just rub a bunch of dishes in spaghetti sauce so she has dishes to do
Edward Ekstrom
Or just poop on the carpet then step on it.
Merit Egan
Take a pee on all my clothes
Edward Ekstrom
On a more serious note, you should probably get her something to open on Christmas.
Merit Egan
wise eddy
Brayden Haws
Yeah she'll want something
Merit Egan
I should have never let her open it early
Edward Ekstrom
Haha that is right.
Brayden Haws
Even if they say they don't you know they do
Merit Egan
#year2mistake
Edward Ekstrom
Definitely haws.
Merit Egan
#improveeveryyear
Edward Ekstrom
I have many sisters and they always tell me she doesn't mean the things she says she won't feel bad about.
Like not having anything to open on Christmas.
Brayden Haws
Just to be safe I'm gonna wait and make kasey open her presents the day after Xmas, cover my but
T
Merit Egan
Is the dollar store a suitable wife christmas shopping place? They have some sweet spatulas there
Colby Condie
Yeah man.
Or get a candle or something. Women love those things
Brayden Haws
Some bath salts
Merit Egan
I don't want her to start chewing off people's arms
Brayden Haws
When Collin went for his mission interview the bishop asked him if he did bath salts
Edward Ekstrom
Hahahaha
Colby Condie
Wait why did he ask Collin that? What the h are bath salts
Merit Egan
they are this regular thing that people turned into drugs
but it makes people way crazy.
One guy found a homeless man and ate his face off. It took multiple bullets to bring him down
Colby Condie
Haha wtf
Merit Egan
Another guy jumped into his neighbors backyard and ate their dog
Colby Condie
The walking dead
Brayden Haws
Yeah bath salts are things girls put in the tub to make it feel good. But drug people have made a drug that looks just like it and it just makes you bat shit crazy like merit said
Merit Egan
haha well put
Brayden Haws
So don't get Kelli those actually
Edward Ekstrom
I heard someone ripped out their own intestines and threw them at someone.
Not sure if it'
s true, but they sounded sure.
Merit Egan
haha that would be terrible to come back to reality
What's all this guts, oh it's my guts
Tyson Amundsen
15 trees
Tyson Amundsen
Guys does anyone wanna ski free at 3 at Alta today?
Merit Egan
If I did not have to work, I would seriously consider it
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah this is a quick random for anyone out there. I do think we ought to schedule a day first week of January to all go and plan on
John Sherwood
Shiz I want to way bad. Alas, work. Let's plan one soon though
Agreed.
Brayden Haws
Mert are you going to dinner tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
I would recommend it Merit. Dinner is an important part of my daily schedule
Merit Egan
I am not going to dinner, and I am going home teaching this evening. Gotta get them presents out

Brayden Haws
Oh hell, well I don't wanna go now

Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Yeah merit.
Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
I'll bring the bath salts
Brayden Haws
If you asked my sentiments I'd say they were exactly yours merit
Merit Egan
This is fantastic news
Tyson Amundsen
Whats going on? Why do I feel like you two have secret plans with your wives? If there are dinner plans I'm coming, no question
Merit Egan
haha kelli and kasey are going to dinner with the likes of becca, ashley, tara and maybe others. So it really should be a girls night out.
Colby Condie
Yeah haws you can't go. Not now. Not nevah

Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Can you play doot on a computer with people on ps?
Merit Egan
No not yet. Which is gay. I hear they will implement cross platform in the near future.
Merit Egan changed the topic to Tech Squad
Edward Ekstrom
Nice, then I will join you guys.
Merit Egan changed the topic to Tech Squadzzerzzzz
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I hate systems.
When I can play with you guys from my computer, I'm in.
Edward Ekstrom
I'm getting a 27" monitor for christmas.  2560 x 1440 resolution.
It basically provides better resolution than my real eyes.  #iRobot
Merit Egan
haha. mine is only 22 inches and 1920 x 1080
Edward Ekstrom
If it thinks that the world would be a better place without me, I wouldn't even be mad because it's probably correct.
Your monitor at home mrt?
Merit Egan
my work one
I only have a laptop at home at the moment
Edward Ekstrom
Oh, this is for at home.
So when I can someday play doot with you guys, my crosshairs will be on your heads real quick.
Merit Egan

#zanzibar
Edward Ekstrom
Haha yeaherrrr
Merit Egan
I think it's 01100100101100100101001010101101001010111000011010010101010
Colby Condie
No I think it's 011001001011001001010010101011010010101110000110100101010101. You left out the last 1

Bryan Samuelson
Hold up, hold up. They have the grinch cartoon in theaters?!!
Brayden Haws
At the dollar
Bryan Samuelson
Sweet mercy
That's great news
Tyson Amundsen
How does the grinch excite you more than saratov? B the cartoon is like 30 mins and I own it. Might as well watch my cartoon than go to pay. And I don't know that I like the Jim carrey.
If we see saratov we don't have to read our scriptures today
Brayden Haws
Guys I gotta get out of going to this dinner

Brayden Haws
Well I wanted to ditch but then kasey j comes home with a new manning shirt for me, it's like a bride and a threat
Tyson Amundsen
Why did she give it to you today? Jeez ppl Christmas is two days away. Since it was unlawful for her to give it today, you don't legally need to respond today
Brayden Haws
Great point Tyson, if I ever run a man down in my car, I'm hiring you as my legal counsel
Seth Vance

Alex Crawford
Merry Christmas to all! What a glorious day. And I have had an itching for halo for a long time but it turns out my brother stole all my games, similar to Chris with the N64. I'm in anytime. #bigbrotherthieves
Tyson Amundsen
Gotta love the once-a-week Crawdad google voxes haha. But you are busy and married, so i don´t blame you
Alex Crawford
Yeah man I've had family over so it's been a little crazy.
Still working on a profile pic as well.
Thursday, December 26, 2013 9:00 AM
Seth Vance
Merry Christmas from B-town Indiana.
...it's still Christmas in the eastern time zone.
Edward Ekstrom
Good morning voxerica
Tyson Amundsen
Good morning gents. Party plans for the next few days? I wanna party. Tomorrow night everyone is invited to my brothers reception should you desire to come
John Sherwood
It's frost's reception too. Except that is far
Tomorrow. And ya it's a party week.
I want to see everyone's new gadgets, bling and spunky attire.
Tyson Amundsen
Congrats Jen, congrats Chris, congrats Creed on Saturday? His reception is in Provo. idk about that one either. Tonight I have a family deal but daytime and Saturday I'm good to go
System link sometime perhaps, with mountain dew and hectors? Maybe
Edward Ekstrom
I want to halo, system link at my apt in provo
John Sherwood
Oh how I would love to system link. Also Saturday is Julias birthday so we may try to go ice skating or bowling or something. Everyone is invited. I'll inform the masses when we know
Merit Egan
I'm in
All of it
Brayden Haws
I would love halo and all partying. Tyson what time does Chris reception go tomo?
Colby Condie
On Saturday, I'll be at Creed's sealing and reception in the evening. Whoever wants to join me for the reception in Orem is welcome
Tyson Amundsen

Erstwhile anyone wanna watch Liverpool Manchester City? Kicks in half hour
Edward Ekstrom
I love software development.

Out of like 30 developers in our department.
You just work whenever you want to.

Merit Egan
No work til Monday. Beautiful
Edward Ekstrom
Lucky
Tyson Amundsen
Merit come over
Merit Egan
I'm busy until evening time
Brayden Haws
Guys I have to go to the ballet tomo, that should be a cultural adventure. Is it kosher to pull a middle school move and hide my earphones up my sleeve and lean on my land and listen to it the whole time?
John Sherwood
Ha I'd recommend it. I went on Monday. There were only two cool dances. The Russians and the Asians.
Merit Egan
In todays modern style of tight shirts and stylish hair, it can be difficult to successfully pull it off
Brayden Haws
Merit just tell Kelli to go with kasey and then we'll play halo
Merit Egan
Haha I just tried, but apparently we are going on a double date with tdog tomorrow
Brayden Haws
Dah, I tried way hard to convince her to take Kelli the other night
Merit Egan
It was a good and Noble plan. Switch out the tickets for jazz tickets.
Brayden Haws
Jazz, monster jam, wrestling, red bull flutag, I'll take anything
Tyson Amundsen
dude I will go with kasey if she is going to see The Nutcracker, that's what's up
Brayden Haws
Fact I love Xmas and the nutcracker, but right now I'm just not feeling it
Tyson Amundsen
a wise man once said "this too shall pass"
Merit tell talmage that Grenade by bruno mars is on right now
Merit Egan
Haha just never ending of singing grenade at my house
Edward Ekstrom
Ask talmage if he wants to go out with emma saturday night.
My family is doing a group date and Emma said I could set her up with him.
Bryan Samuelson
Ayooo. Blood brothers
Brayden Haws
Eddy set me up with Emma
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah wtf eddy
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, you stopped talking to her.
It's your own da*n vault.
Talmage is next in line.
Tyson Amundsen
She disappeared into the depths of Greek life. Agree to disagree. And agree with Haws and Bryan who can second and third my witness as current Utes
Brayden Haws
That is true
Tyson is true
The Mormon is true
Edward Ekstrom
False
Emma thought tyson was a neat dude then he stopped talking to her.
I swear by the stars.
John Sherwood
32 across: nerdy guy = dweeb. 33 down: weak-willed = wussy. Negative messages
Donezo
Colby Condie
I can actually vouch for eddy on the Emma thing. Emma told me she wondered why you stopped talking to her Teez.
She said she liked hanging out with you
Edward Ekstrom
Fact
Merit Egan
The trutg comes out
Edward Ekstrom
Colby is a wise truth-speaker.
Merit Egan
Truth
Edward Ekstrom
Now Talmage is heir to the throne.
And Merit and I will be brothers-in-law once removed.
Merit Egan
Haha how glorious
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not willing to accept all blame for this. Various circumstances including those which I've alluded to must be considered as well. But I'm not worried. I will authorize talmage to deputize in my absence
A pinch hit, if you will Colby
Colby Condie
Talmage pass off
John Sherwood
Scottie and I are skiing on jan 1 at the Bird. Anyone else is welcome
Tyson Amundsen
I have mouth surg on the 31st. Nothing major, but I won't be jumping any cliffs on the 1st. I'll plan on it

We had 6 second row tickets.
Could we get anyone?  nope...
So we sat with two empty seats on each side of us.
#theBulgeFromUpClose
Is anyone doing anything besides cracking their nuts tonight?
Brayden Haws
I was in the bathroom at the mall, this guy just came out of the stall butt naked
zach fackrell
Haha I remember that quite vividly eddy.

I also recall that after the nutcracker ended we went outside and had to cross the street to get to your truck and instead of just walking across the street, and with the ballet bulge still fresh in your mind, you leaped and bounded and merrily danced across the street hahahah
John Sherwood
Skwig sighting
Colby Condie
Hahaha I remember that eddy. I had something I couldn't get out of that night or else I would have gladly come and watched men's bulges in tights
Edward Ekstrom

Walter Mitty is good. Slower movie but cool shots and a bit humorous
Bryan Samuelson
Warmest birthday regards to Julia! And warmest wedding regards to Creed. Unfortunately I'm house/dog sitting tonight, and thus unable to attend these activities

This is my life now
Colby Condie
Bryan is growing up before our eyes. Legit job
Bryan Samuelson

Tyson Amundsen
Thanks for the pic, I forgot who he was
Does he have a Wikipedia page? Read us his bio
Brayden Haws
And he just lights himself on fire and then does a front flip and burns everyone
Dhalsim (ダルシム Darushimu?, Hindi: धल्सिम), is a video game character in the Street Fighter fighting game series who made his debut in the original Street Fighter II as one of the game's eight main characters. In his backstory, Dhalsim is depicted as an Indian yogi, a husband and father, and a pacifist who goes against his beliefs by entering the World Warrior tournament to raise money for his village. He later appears in subsequent installments of the Street Fighter series, including Street Fighter Alpha 3, Street Fighter IV, X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter.
Tyson Amundsen

And as one of merits counselors, I'd like to remind Tyson that the patriarch has vox immunity and can speak when he wishes
Bryan Samuelson
I saw it on Christmas, I concur with Merit and Haws
I took a nap in the middle of the movie, if that tells you anything
Brayden Haws
That's hard to weigh cause Bryan always sleeps

Brayden Haws
She's pretty, went to Brighton, goes to the U
Tyson Amundsen
I file a discovery claim
Brayden Haws
I gotta find you dudes some wives, I'm scouting
Colby Condie
Tyson can marry Katie Harris
Bryan can marry her friend Kelsey Edman
Tyson Amundsen
I'll marry all 3
Then I won't have to have a church calling
Colby Condie
Then Tyson would be boomin and bangin every day
Jeff Knudsen
If anyone is down for a temple visit tomorrow let me know
Colby Condie
Jeff I'm already planning on going tomorrow. Which temple are you going to?
Jeff Knudsen

Tyson Amundsen
I work all night, will come home and need a few hours of sleep. I was gonna ski after that but I could maybe temple. Maybe.
John Sherwood
It's important
Tyson Amundsen
I'm sorry Draper is far for you Juan, cuz its superior to J Riv
IMO
John Sherwood
I agree. I'd trek if need be. Isn't slc superior above all else?
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe. For endowments I say yes, but idk about the baptistry. I can't remember it, its been a long time since I've been there. Oquirrh mountain is rad but we sure ain't going there
John Sherwood
Ya drapers font is way good. "Holiness to the lord"
Brayden Haws

Edward Ekstrom
Got my grades, straight As and a B+ in Doctrine and Covenants. BYU is lame at times
No mesa
It's 75 here all weekend
Colby Condie
Sounds gorgeous
The weather, not BYU
Edward Ekstrom
Response to gaydar guesses earlier. Tanner Dewaal is super feminine but extremely nice. I like him. Also like bo Palmer, way nice
They are the kind of feminine guys who are going to have model wives.
Colby Condie
I thought Alex Stuhf would be gay. Too much muscle for his own good
Plus steroids can mess with your mind
Brayden Haws

The only person he could love is himself
He's gay for himself
Colby Condie
Hahahahahahaha
Jeff Knudsen
OK I'm in for J Riv or SLC. SL temp at 12:45?
John Sherwood

Jeff Knudsen
12:45 it is
Merit Egan
12:45 indeed. i won't be there, but meet at 12:45
Colby Condie
Merit that means I can't play words with friends from 12:45-1:45. Roughly
Merit Egan

Jeff Knudsen

Tyson Amundsen
Hot shiz. I totally had his uncle for general chemistry, no doubt in my mind
Alex Platis
It's

John Sherwood

Brayden Haws
Good morning voxers
Merit Egan
Good morning! Good news, after 2 1/2 days, my headache is gone. Never before and never again.

Terrible morning! I woke up with the worst headache of my life. Literally pounding. What did you do to me merit?
SV
Merit Egan
I spread it through the vox. It was the worst. I tried to send it to Zach Galifinakis, I guess I messed up the spell. Le gardium headachosa zach galifinackrell
Colby Condie
I just had a magic poop on this Sunday morning.. The church is true.
Magic poop = requires no wiping
Brayden Haws
I forgot we had morning church now, slept til 11 and now I'm just watching the nfl
#inactive
John Sherwood
I had a crazy dream guys.. we were all larping in a huge castle and jeff cardon was trying to get me for half the dream. Whacko huh
Brayden Haws
Haha dood that's awesoem
Awesome, I want a dream like that minus Jeff cardon
John Sherwood
Ya it was awesome that we were all building friendship with larp. But lame about cardon
Also, bachelor is on tonight and tomorrow. Who is in for fantasy bachelor? (We pick 3 gals and whoever gets the most in the top 3 wins the bachelor bucks)
Colby Condie
Ha I think I'm in. When does it start
John Sherwood
Tonight we meet juan Pablo. Not completely necessary for your picks. But it could provide insight. Tomorrow is when we enter our picks
After the first episode. Starts at 7 I bet
Alex Crawford
And by popular demand I've put a face to my name. Does anybody know if the same picture pops up anytime you send an email with the same gmail?
That is undesirable in this instance.
Seth Vance
Dunno. I'll send you an email.
Colby Condie
I still don't see a pic Crawdad
Seth Vance
I see it. Looking good crawdad.
Alex Crawford
I'm attempting to disable this feature in all but hangouts...standby for further help Seth
Alex Platis
Let me in on this info if you figure it out crawdad
Bryan Samuelson
That's a funny idea John. I've never watched the bachelor, but that's a funny idea
zach fackrell
Jeff when do you leave for the promised land? #mazatlan
John Sherwood
It's a good activity bsam. For both men and women.
Jeff Knudsen
I depart Tuesday morning, Shalom to you all!
Bryan Samuelson
Jeffrey we love you and will miss you dearly
Jeff Knudsen
Thank you BSam, Kelsi Cullimore is on the Bach Bach?  What in the world.  Haha her brother, my brother's friend, is scared that she will go far and they will go meet the family because their house is a decked out in Disney
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson

Edward Ekstrom

Got left at the lodge, is it anyone's?
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to I got soul but I'm not a soldier, I got soul but I'm not a soldier, I GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDIER
Colby Condie
We can have pizza and snacks at my place. Who is coming to watch the game?
zach fackrell

Merit Egan
Undecided. School til 7... Not sure of the happppppppps after
Edward Ekstrom
Strange site huh
zach fackrell
Whoa man
Colby Condie
And eddy I have an HP laptop with Windows 7
Edward Ekstrom
Does anyone use it anymore?
Or is it just sitting/
?
Colby Condie
Ya it's what I use currently
Edward Ekstrom
Oh that doesn't work then
I need a spare windows key that isn't being used.
Colby Condie
Aahh  see
Edward Ekstrom
I partitioned my harddrive and installed windows on half of it but I'm using a jacked key off the internet that will only work for 30 days.
Brayden Haws
Colb I'll come after class. It ends at 7 but hopefully I'm out early today
Merit Egan
eddy use your programming skills and make my website cool  http://gobigt.weebly.com/
make a code that give me a million dollars every time someone clicks on anything
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
into my savings. account # 3940293459034958072035
Alex Platis
Just search for a code online and look on torrent sites for one
Tyson Amundsen
Can we do a roll call for colbys house tonight? My mom has offered a Caesar salad so I need an idea of who is coming
Merit Egan
I think I am a no. If I show up I won't eat.
Brayden Haws
I'll be there, about 7ish I hope
Alex Platis
No Al. Just landed in LA. Boo.
John Sherwood
Dang al. Dang tyson. I think ju and I are actually not in for tonight
Sorry colb. No.chips
zach fackrell
I'm in. Yes Zach
Tyson Amundsen
So that's me, Zach, Haws, colb: 4 thus far
Colby Condie
I will have probably already eaten when you guys come. So if someone wants to bring some pizzas or something you can. We have some chips and dip here as well
Brayden Haws
Whoa Colby just tear my heart out, don't wanna dine with us
Colby Condie
Haha I'll still dine with you chaps. It's just my mother made dinner for my sister and I.. Before I told her you guys were coming over. So there's not enough for everyone and I don't wanna deny mamma Condie's home cookin'
Tyson Amundsen
Haws, wanna pick up some hectors for us on the way down?
It's an option
Tyson Amundsen changed the topic to Jewish Cop Syndicate
zach fackrell
Or a pizza. Id eat that shiz all day
Brayden Haws
I'd be fine with either
All the uglys take night classes
#lepercolony
Alex Crawford
I would like to come but I new to talk Meg into it. I'm a maybe.
Also it's the first day of class and I'm assigned a reading by a guy who changed his last name to an ancient word meaning "of the Forrest" to symbolize his love of trees. He also majored in non-classical logic. Wouldn't non-classical logic be considered illogical? #environmentalethicsblows
Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to Jewish Cop Syndicate
Alex Crawford
Please someone justify the utter uselessness and my new found hatred of environmental philosophy.
Brayden Haws
I'll grab some little c's on my way?
Two pizzas?
Pepperoni crazy crust?
zach fackrell
Are you already on your way home? I'd say yes
Brayden Haws
No I'm at class, I'd bet I'll be at colbs at 715-730
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe. I feel like its just the 3 of us, and I have accepted an indoor soccer assignment later. i need to eat so I'll eat at home
Alex, environmental philosophy is not logical at all. Thank you for your testimony
For instance, they no longer call it "global warming" but now use "climate change" because its more ambiguous. And because last year the earth cooled
Colby Condie
Wait Tyson are you coming tonight?
And there will be me haws Tyson Zach and Minni. Anyone can come though. Females of all friends too
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I will for a bistsky
Colby Condie
Booo. Why you no stay?
Bryan Samuelson
I'll be there Colb. Slightly late arrival. Eta of 7 or 8, depending on whether or not I go to my fhe
Colby Condie
Good Bryan
Brayden Haws
I'll be late prob 8 or later, school is gayzer
Tyson, Bryan; there is an old man in my class, he has made 10 comments in the first hour
Colby Condie
When should I start the game? It sounds like everyone is coming late
Alex Crawford
Tyson, does this mean that there won't be any salad?
Brayden Haws
I'm eating right now, so I don't think I'll bring pizza, I'm gonna be here for the long haul
Colby Condie
Are you coming at all haws?
Brayden Haws
I may, my class is supposedly going til 8, so idk. I figured we'd just have a quick one today but I was wrong
zach fackrell
Yes haws you were quite wrong indeed
Colby Condie
Is anyone coming over?? Jk. But really..
Alex Crawford
Megan and I are in for sure now. Chalk up two more. We won't be there till around 7:20 ish. Same as BSam.
zach fackrell
Alright 7:30 arrival time it is
Brayden Haws
My class just hates capitalism, everyone just wants the government and everyone else to do everything for them
Alex Crawford
Tell them about your grandpa Haws, that'll change their mind. Just replay your boxer about kids and they will come to their senses b
Merit Egan
just say this in class for every comment: "The invisible hand is becoming increasingly visible."
Alex Crawford
Voxer*
Colby Condie
Just stand up and moon the whole class
Brayden Haws
I just read this part of an article about bill gates about how he became a programmer, and how every student at his university had the same access to the computers that he did but that he just sacrificed his social life and sleep to work extra time programming. And then I just said that there's no way it's correct to punish him by taking his income just because he worked harder than others
Merit Egan
I'm officially a senior you guys!
Brayden Haws
Now everyone just hates me
Bryan Samuelson
I'm coming Colb. Probably 8 o'clock arrival. But feel free to start without me
Tyson Amundsen
Haws way to go man. Way to go
Brayden Haws
I'm not about that Tyson, you know me

Brayden Haws
Al's just shucking and jiving
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
UpdateDay 2 of my eye is vastly improved. In many ways- I can open my eye now. Its a nice shade of purple. The real problem: I can't feel a third of the side of my face. Nerves being pinched or something
Merit Egan
shiz teez. You cannot have another strange injury. #PrayforTeez
Tyson Amundsen
I know man, thanks for any and all #prayforteez thoughts. I'll find out tomo if I broke anything
Merit Egan
#TrackerUpdate from the #Tracker'sDiary
Today I failed inspections. My power steering has been acting up. Like is still works, I just have some pains. Anyway, I saw Merit's face when they said I had failed. I let him down. Well, hopefully I get to go get a nice car massage and soon I will be back on the road! Until next time,
Tracker
Colby Condie
Hahaha way to be Tracker. Keep your head up
Merit Egan
Colby that is quite enough games
Colby Condie
Hahaha haws and I had 10 games once upon a time
Brayden Haws
That is what is know as the Colby syndrome, he can never have enough games going
They when you take your turn it takes and hour and by the time you finish, Colby has already gone and it's your turn again
Colby Condie
That's what I do. It's how I win
Merit Egan
Haha well let's get a few more going
Colby Condie
Except merit has beat me in every game as of late... I needa change my strategy
Merit Egan
We had some close ones. Anyone else want to play?

Merit Egan changed the topic to Heman Woman Haters Club
Merit Egan

zach fackrell
Colby's dancing is the best. Whacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men
The first planned activity of this new named group should be system linking. let's play halo
Merit Egan
GNO this weekend?
Colby Condie

This solo by Zach is one of my favorite parts of the Swiss video
Tyson Amundsen
That was a great part. I watched that video so much last night, it really brought me thru
I could totally GNO. And halo, I've got a halo attitude
My problem is I don't contribute much to system link. No paddles, consoles, or Adonal Foyle's. Only one tv so my house isn't great. But I bring a party attitude and the spirit of camaraderie. And M&Ms
Merit Egan
I am only good for feef supplies. When it comes to Halo supplies, I bring nothing except party attitude, the spirit of comaradarie, and driving ghosts and warthogs
and obliterating Eddy while he tries to snipe on his various perches
zach fackrell
When it comes to contributing I don't contribute much, other than a party attitude, spirit of commandeering, a broken xbox and crappy controllers
Merit Egan
BLAM BLAM
Colby Condie
I don't contribute much either... Just a attitude of partying, chips and salsa, an N64, and being an automatic easy kill on Halo for whoever faces me
Merit Egan
haha, colby every team needs someone like that. That's why the Jazz signed John Lucas III
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
I call Colby on my team. We will build a strategy that turns us into a winner!!!! Team stay on the beach always on zanzibar
Brayden Haws
Guys I can contribute to you an xbox with three controllers, and a shirt temper that cause everything to annoy me and piss me off
Colby Condie
Yes merit. #stayonthebeachalways
It's like the Hunger Games. You can't just rush into the bloodbath. You must be wise and strike when they least expect it
Merit Egan
yes, that shall be our strategy
What is everyone's availability for Friday or Saturday?
Colby Condie
That's our "strategy" indeed. But our real strategy we won't reveal. Strategy
Merit Egan
haha
Bryan Samuelson
I contribute someone for Colby to be able to kill, to keep his morale up. I also will take a few shots at the beginning of every round to make sure I know who I am, it's part of my charm. Unfortunately Jeff won't be present, because one of my greatest Halo strengths is punching him. In real life
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I contribute an a** kicking to every opponent.
But we should play on computers. Then we don't need any xboxen and I can pay off site
Merit Egan
Edward come to SLC for the weekend. I have a couch with your name on it
Edward Ekstrom
Although, part of the magic is hearing the other team say awwwwww when you win 49 50
I already have projects due
Want to hear something gay? Byu average for time outside of class per credit hour is 1.
Guess what cs is.
Merit Egan
6
no wait, 5
Edward Ekstrom
3.5
But still
Merit Egan
taht's what i meant, 6 divided by 2, point 5
Brayden Haws
Physics is just a billion, they just want you to declare it's as your religion and to pray to newton
Colby Condie
That's blasphemy haws. We only pray to one person: Mohammed
Tyson Amundsen
Mohammed (Praise be to him) by The Terrorists
Watch for the new hit album
Colby Condie
Guys I just saw a high school flashback working at the UPS store. Hint: it's not Bryan Samuelson
Tyson Amundsen
But holy F guys, major MLS news. Looks like Toronto is shelling out major dough to get Michael Bradley and Jermaine Defoe. Unbelievable about Bradley
Colby I think you saw AJ "eyeball" Watson
Bryan Samuelson
I have insider info here, anyone else care to take a stab at Colb's before I reveal what I believe to be the answer?
Also, that's nuts about Toronto Tys
Brayden Haws
Merit, we have to watch a video of a birth in class, please help me
Colby Condie
Haha great guess Teezr. But it was not eyeball.
Tyson Amundsen
Seeing as I'm the closest guess without going over, I believe that makes me the winner. What was the actual retail price
Bryan Samuelson
Who is Paul Kline?
zach fackrell
Paul Kline is my guess too
John Sherwood
My first guys would be Paul Kline
Colby Condie
Paul Kline! Bingo!
The UPS store on 9400 south and highland
Tyson Amundsen
Wow wow wow how did everyone guess the same thing? #matchfixing
Brayden Haws
Collin wants to know if any of you guys would wanna play ball tonight before he leaves for his mich
Merit Egan
I have the dumb school. I wish the Collin well.
Bryan Samuelson
We've achieved a Zion state within the vox: we are of one heart and one mind
Dude yeah I'd love to play ball with Collin
Colby Condie
Ball tonight? That may be tough for me but I can plan other days no doubt

Jefe Grande????
Colby Condie
There's a coffee joint called Jack Mormon Coffee downtown. Let's go Haws
Brayden Haws
Haha I've driven past that place a bunch of times, always wanted to go in
Merit Egan
They make a mean orange mocha frappuccino
Tyson Amundsen
Here's mEYE update- nothing broken. lots of bleeding in my sinuses. feeling in my face should return in 2 weeks.
Merit Egan
#blessed
Colby Condie
Which means making out with girls also returns in 2 weeks. Unless you just wanna do it now. #NumbMakeout
Teezin n pleezin
Merit Egan
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Brayden Haws
Never take human sexuality, just open the book to find a whole page of vaginas
Merit Egan
Haha. Just let me know if they show miracle of life. I'll be there for moral support
Tyson Amundsen
I could, and did, tell you about this being a result. Now you're going to affect all us single guys by making us think about sex all the time, which is dangerous in the premarital life #superbad
Merit Egan
That must be hard #thatswhatshesaid
Colby Condie
Merit your comment was sympathetic but your hashtag made all us singles think of sex more #counterproductive
Tyson Amundsen
We're doomed
Brayden Haws
Merit we definitely have to watch a birth this semester so I'll invite you along that night
Tyson Amundsen
Wait like live???
Brayden Haws
A video
Tyson Amundsen
Oh well that's old hat. Remember miracle of life? #lauber

I'm can play on xbox live now.
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Haha
What is that from?
Merit Egan
I don't even know. He must be pooping. That's the only explanation.
Tyson Amundsen
*FIRING A RIFLE INTO THE AIR WHILE BALLS DEEP IN SQUEALING HOG
Colby Condie
That looks like it could be from True Grit hahaha
Tyson Amundsen


Colby Condie
Studious
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
Tyson just sits back and makes them study, then they have to tell him everything they learned. #evilgenius
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Edward Ekstrom
why do lefties look so awkward writing?
Merit Egan
They gotta keep that palm up.
Colby Condie
I'll let Bryan answer
Merit Egan
It's hard to keep that up all day... #thatswhatshesaid
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
#humansexuality
Bryan Samuelson
Physics has warped our precious Teezer into a monster. Now we are his slaves
Merit Egan
PromoTeez turned PreciousTeez turned MonsterTeez
Bryan Samuelson
Writing as a left hander is a real struggle, you just get insta smudge all over yourself if you ever write in pencil. Not to mention the coils of notebooks that are cramping you and killing your vibe, nor the stupid college desks that just have the left side cut off
Merit Egan
They should just make special schools with left handed desks and notebooks #segregation
Colby Condie
Hahaha the coils of notebooks is the funniest
Edward Ekstrom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyPip_-qJRs
I wan't to play like this chick.
Merit Egan
Brian, on behalf of white, right handed men everywhere, I apologize for our negligence towards your people
Bryan Samuelson
I appreciate that Merit. I feel confident that with bipartisan support and the leadership of community icons such as yourself, we can move forward towards a better tomorrow
Merit Egan
To quote the late Allen Iverson, "this is not a game, not a game." I truly believe we cannot act as if equality is simply a game.
   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI
Bryan Samuelson
On behalf of the left handed delegation, I approve this message
Merit Egan
Could we get a halo night together tomorrow with zach gone? Do we have the means?
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha man merit I forgot how funny that was
I would halo. Or see enders game. I contributed my Sandy Movies 9 for Ender and my house with no tvs and xboxes for the game #notpractice
Merit Egan
If Halo is not feasible, we all know that Fifa is
also Call of Duty could be feasible
Big Team Battle
Bryan Samuelson
Feefa is always feesible
Colby Condie
Feefa is feasible and feafable
Merit Egan
we will be unfeatable
undefeefed
Brayden Haws
We have an Xbox and controllers but not disc
Tyson Amundsen
Thinking outside the xbox- can we system link feef?
Merit Egan
I don't understand the need... All the controllers connect wireless and you can have up to 8
Tomorrow night roll call for whatever our GNO is. Me: 1
Tyson Amundsen
Well stated merit. Not tonight?
John Sherwood
We should sled and then feef tonight
Merit Egan
Sled and feef tonight. coed?
John Sherwood
Coed
Sled coed. Gals can chat for feefs
And make skirts
Merit Egan
Coed tonight and GNO tomorrow? Or is this one in the same tonight?
Colby Condie
Sledding would be way fun
John Sherwood
Whichever
Merit Egan
whomever
John Sherwood
Sugarhouse sled? Feef after
Colby Condie
Whyever
Merit Egan
I'm in
Colby Condie
Me too
John Sherwood
Me too
Bryan Samuelson
I am also in
John Sherwood
Receptive idea
Colby Condie
It's because the patriarch was the first to commit
Merit Egan
Follow the patriarch, follow the patriarch, follow the patriarch don't go astray
Colby Condie
What time would sledding be?
Bryan Samuelson
The patriarch built a lot of goodwill in the community by reaching out to the left handers, no way we could refuse him after that
Merit Egan
Next I will reach out to people with numb faces. There is a significant population
7 or 7:30pm MST sled time? I can bring my feef equipment to a larger house with more space
John Sherwood
8 is next for ju and I
Best
Tyson Amundsen
Where is there sledding at sugar mamas?
I love feeling included
Merit Egan
teez you know we need you in the midfield. You have the most fake life soccer experience.
Colby Condie
That park where they do July 4 fireworks there's a huge hill great for sledding
Merit Egan
#colbyknowledge
Brayden Haws
Is the pond frozen? You could just sled down the hill and right across the ice, that'd be tight
Merit Egan
replace you with we and I'll be happy
Tyson Amundsen
I have almost no sleds/tubes unless I check the rafters. But I have plenty of warm clothing
Plan is sugarhouse sledding then a FIFA feast?
John Sherwood
I like it
Colby Condie
What time is sledding? 6? 7? 8?
Merit Egan
Lets say 7:30, then it will be 8.
Colby Condie
The patriarch has spoken. Let it be written, let it be done
Tyson Amundsen
Deustchin' effin'
I work til 10 now, my coworker has a fever and I owed him one.
I'm out for sledding
Merit Egan
Fuh
Colby Condie
Fuh bi
Brayden Haws
What a bish
Colby Condie
In case anyone wants to know, merit and I are in a massively intense barn burnin' game of words with friends right now
Merit Egan
This is true, one of our 16 active games
Meanwhile john beat me by 2 yesterday
Tyson Amundsen
Guys I need to talk about my feelings. I'm feeling hungry
Colby Condie
Teez when do you work?
Tyson Amundsen
I was supposed to be off at 7. Now I'm off like 10. I may be able to adapt my circumstances to include food
Colby Condie
You haven't eaten dinner? Tyson we will save you from the enemy that holds you bound
Merit Egan
Teez bust the joint
Tyson Amundsen
It's only 6, has anyone eaten? My options consist of getting takeout delivered, you ppl coming for an indoor picnic, eating nutella sandwiches and cup of noodles here, or hectors when I get off to prepare for feef
Merit, yes
Bryan Samuelson
Merit, Sam the ball kicker has asked about the nights activities. Patriarchal approval to invite to sledding?
Tyson Amundsen
Give him a swear quota if you do. He won't want to Feefa
Tyson Amundsen
BOOYEA!! Events have occurred- I'm free
John Sherwood
Ayo. Sled teezer?
Who has sleds/tubes?
I have 1
Merit Egan
Bsam, enlighten me on who sam the balk kicker is. I know sam garbett and sam mcconks, but no other sam is coming to mind
Tyson Amundsen
Merit ate you coming sleighing?
Bryan Samuelson
Sam Casaday, friends with Jason Erickson, I know him through Tyson. He's a party guy, has come to various and sundry pool parties at Zach's and BNDR's
Colby Condie
Who has sleds? Important part of sledding
Tyson Amundsen
Colby do you have any? Haws merit Bryan? I may have some of someone can pick them up.
John Sherwood
Someone stop at merits parents for sleds. Where is the meeting point? Egans? The slopes?
Colby Condie
I might have some. I can swing by my house to see. I'm at Minni's and just ate dinner
Merit Egan
I'm open for all meeting locations
Tyson Amundsen
Do you live close merit?
Merit Egan
Indeed I do
Colby Condie
Merit I can go pass by your house maybe.
For sleds
Tyson Amundsen
Meet at merits house
Merit Egan
Negatory on the sleds at my house. Nepheww have lost them
Maybe it's just a hot cocoa night from 7-11
Bryan Samuelson
I'm fine either way.
But the question is do I head to merits now? Do I bring snow clothes?
Tyson Amundsen
Yes right now
Don't bail
Unless we have no sleds
Bryan Samuelson
Well obviously I'm still on for FIFA. The real question is about snow cloths and boots
I'll leave now
Tyson Amundsen
You have boots man
Brayden Haws
Guys I'm back, I'm here on the vox
Sorry I was gone
Tyson great vm where are you?
Tyson Amundsen
Bull Shi*

Haws man I am on my way to Merritt's house with John
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

Brayden Haws
Sledding? Feef? What's the happs right now?

Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
How is there doubt what we are doing?
You're a sharp kid Haws
Merit Egan
Sleigh riding
Brayden Haws
I menat what was happening at this time? The sledding or the feef?
Shut up Tyson, I solved the hardest physics
On my own
Merit Egan
Feef comes soon
Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson

Tyson Amundsen

zach fackrell
I am a weird kid. But back then I really had no idea what was happening. I look crazy
Edward Ekstrom
Your hair is hilarious
Brayden Haws
Watched the vid I lol'ed, I don't think I'm allowed to party tonight due to our impending GNO
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Thank you Tyson, I thank you as does kasey j

Luke got engaged?? My mom just text me
Tyson Amundsen
Oh my word
Bryan Samuelson
Haws tell kasey the TLC comment was a joke
Colbs car: I wanted a five. That's what that was
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not sure Bryan. They need to be more freedom of expression in the vox. No pressure from outside people being able to see it
Brayden Haws
Yeah man, she didn't see it, rarely so I show her, sometimes I let her talk on voxer but that about all
Woman haters
Bryan Samuelson
Haha ok, just trying to be diplomatic here
Colby Condie
Bryan yes I saw your desire to do a high five to my car, but I couldn't get the window down quick enough
Seth Vance
Guys, I have sleds in my garage.
#toolittletoolate
You're welcome to use them though... I think we have like 3 or 4.
Colby Condie

My arrival is delayed. Pray for me
John Sherwood

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Colbie you can solve that problem. Why don't you just go in there and say that you have to leave?
#wheretheresawill
Colby Condie

I actually really do love flamingos
Sunday, January 12, 2014 9:44 AM
Tyson Amundsen
Collin is at 1 Haws?
Edward Ekstrom
Does anyone here pay tithing online?
And Jeff, have you found your wife yet? After all, your parents met there. It's fate that you do.
Merit Egan
I do not pay my tithing online. #oldschool
Tyson Amundsen
Is it even possible to pay tithing online?
Merit Egan
I wonder that also
Brayden Haws
Yeah it's at one
You can pay online? Sign me up?
Tyson Amundsen
I can see how online would be so applicable in todays world. But I personally feel an advantage of paying in person is there is a certain amount of accountability involved with face to face contact. You must physically go before the bishop, be in the church
Colby Condie
Yeah back in the day you couldn't slay your best lamb and submit your sacrifice online.
Merit Egan
Tithing settlement brings in accountibility as well.
Ultimately it's not a game changer. I mean you are already at church, so it's easy to hand it to someone.
Brayden Haws
I def agree with the accountability factor of in person but the convenience factor would also be nice seeing as how checks and cash are not the preferred currency these days
Tyson Amundsen
All valid points. It kinda reminds me of our missions when less actives would ask us to take their tithing to the bishop. Not the best example of course, but you see what I mean
Brayden Haws
What? I never had anyone ask me that. That's funny. Maybe they didn't trust me and thought I would steal it
Edward Ekstrom
Send an email here to set up online tithing.
donations@ldschurch.org
I sent the email this morning.
I'm sick of checks
Colby Condie
I'm very intrigued in the online pay. Honestly it makes it easier cause you don't have to remember to get cash and the exact amount every time
Brayden Haws
Yeah my line of thinking is usually when I remember to pay my tithing am already at church and have left the cash or check for it at home. So if I was at church and remembered I could just pay it on my phone right then
Colby Condie
Well put Haws. I do that all the time
Brayden Haws
I did that just today
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, it's genius
Seth Vance
So would it take out 10% of your paycheck automatically? ..or you just have the option of paying online if you want to, like if you forgot cash/check?
Edward Ekstrom
Not sure, I bet I'll hear back from them this week and I can let you know how it works
Edward Ekstrom
The true vox is alive and well everyone
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/Yw3jCr-IUHQ
Tyson Amundsen
Haha hot dang, that was great. last year only me and Bryan went and we had to recruit Sam the ball kicker with some people
Merit Egan
Everyone left their fifa controllers here. Does that mean we are playing again soon?
Bryan Samuelson
I think so. I mean, I have to
come pick it up anyway, and if I just grab the controllers and leave, is that an effective use of gas? It would be much more practical and environmentally conscious to take a few friends with me and stay for a few hours
Brayden Haws
The longer you stay the better the investment
zach fackrell

Colby look. Pistachio gelato
Tyson Amundsen
Facklemore
zach fackrell
Tyson. I want you to have crazy hair with me
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson would look awesome
Tyson Amundsen
Let's be honest guys, if I had enough good hair I would do it. And by good hair I mean hair
Tho I appreciate both those comments haha
Colby Condie
Haha nice Zach. Your hair is way tall right now.
And how does the pistachio compare to Avalon in Bolzano Zach? Let me answer that: it doesn't
zach fackrell
Colby let me reply to your answer. You're right. It was like eating cardboard. Which is a terrible flavor for gelato
Merit Egan
Cause he looks like a dinosaur
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Hahaha yes merit

Brayden Haws
Haha mert I remember you telling me about having laxative parties on your mish
Merit Egan
Haha on exchanges we would do laxatives at night and it was so funny. By like 9 the next morning you were back to normal, but the night was soooo funny
Alex Crawford
Are these things true? We should totally buy a bag.
Colby Condie

Merit Egan viewed my Linked In profile. Maybe he will hire me
John Sherwood
Is linked in a wise thing to have?
Colby Condie
I just started using mine. It's pretty cool. Get a lot of business connections
Merit Egan
Yeah it's good to build a network. I used it a ton in recruiting.
Colb, how does 1 million a year sound?
John Sherwood
I'll set one up. I want to build a canzerrzzz heimerzz jewish syndicate network
Merit Egan
Yes sir. Now that you are graduated you just will get a real life job
Colby Condie
Merit I'll only take it if I get full benefits and Jazz season tickets
Merit Egan
Would you mind if I also gave you a bonus of 300,000 a year?
I have a negotiations class tonight, I should show this as an example of perfect negotiation.
Colby Condie
No I only want 200,000 bonus. Thanks for the offer but I must politely decline
Merit Egan
I will personally see that you never get a job in this town!
Tyson Amundsen
my takeaway from today is that I need to read whatever article hot posted

Edward Ekstrom
Holy awesome!
John Sherwood
How much is one million google bucks?
zach fackrell
Like a couple hundred real dollars
Merit Egan
how do you use it?
Tyson Amundsen
Awesome zeez. I saw a post today from a guy in my ward looking for filmers for Sundance. He might have filled it, but there's that too
zach fackrell
What's his contact info? I'll look him up
Haha guys they're paying me in real dollars like $500
They were like "hey we wanna use your video for our commercial"

And I was like "sure"
Tyson Amundsen
Boomin and Bangin. Look thru my friends on Facebook, his name is Travis babcock. Also Haws
Brayden Haws
I might have his number, let me check
Tyson Amundsen
We borrowed his production van to haul all those trees for Chris reception, it was baller. Just a huge whitey
zach fackrell
I just messaged him. Thanks for the heads up
Tyson Amundsen
Good. In other news, a girl at school recognized me from slacklining over the pool last year at a party #boomin #bangin
The catch: it was that one Latin girl Bryan took on a date
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan

It's physics...

Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie
Bryan it's a possibility. I'm off at 7 today. When are you going?
Bryan Samuelson
Good Colb. I'd like to arrive on time, potentially early for better seats, but I don't have a set time
Tyson Amundsen
i'll stream it live for the lamb to watch with me
Tyson Amundsen
Ok friends, lets talk weekend party plans. Saturday night I want to go to the US Freeskiing Grand Prix in Park City where they will have slopestyle and halfpipe competitions. Its free and will be fun. There will be some big time skiiers there who will be in the olympics. 630, followed by festivities. Potential for hot chocolate, hot tubbing, hot babes, hot dang! Something for us all
John Sherwood
I'm in. Oh I'm in. Possibly for tonight too bsam
Brayden Haws
Bring on the babes!!!
Colby Condie
Get some chicks on the walls
Tyson Amundsen
Good Haws. I take it you will be attending with me John and Julia?
Bryan Samuelson
Tys that sounds great. Colb and John whets your status for tonight? We've got Zach potentially as well
We welcome late additions to our cause
John Sherwood
Possibly. If yes, a bit late
Bryan Samuelson
Roger that
Colby Condie
I just got home. Bryan are you at home? If I can make it, could I get a ride?
Bryan Samuelson
Absolutely man. I'm at home now, I can pick you up
Friday, January 17, 2014 6:49 AM
Edward Ekstrom
The game's at 8 right? Come get me right I'm ready.
Friday, January 17, 2014 11:00 AM
Alex Crawford
Megan and I were already planning on the freeskiing qualifiers. Please note that there is a free O.A.R. concert afterward. That is a huge perk of going.
Tyson Amundsen
what do you mean "already"? So you're saying you were a hipster because you wanted to do it before I said it? #gaAAYY
Also, I forgot it was OAR. That makes it even better. Why would you go to the qualifiers tho? that turns it into an all day event. Lets just go to the finals at night
Colby Condie
What time is shiz goin down
Tyson Amundsen
Colb we did this yesterday #cominginathalftime
physics hw makes me irritable #apology
Colby Condie
I don't want to search the whole chat for the time
Tyson Amundsen
630 is when the skis hit the slopes
Merit Egan
Where is this?
And what?
And when?
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
And please explain in full detail what the gummy bears thing is.
Tyson Amundsen
oh f. oh h. you're asking us to recount approximately 4 days of google voxes. Might as well ask us to spit and hit the moon
Brayden Haws
Tyson is so mad right now, he keeps threatening to stab me with a letter opener
Alex Crawford
Haha Tyson all I am saying is that you could have assumed I would be in on such an awesome event. No need to ask. You could just inform me that I would be accompanying you. And by qualifiers I meant the finals since this whole competition is made to see who will get to compete in Sochi. Megan and I are also going to ski at pcmr during the day so as to maximize driving efficiency and fun.
Feel free to join
Edward Ekstrom
Annie and I are hiking in Zion tomorrow. Any and all are free to come to join us.
High of 70°
Ayoooooo
Although that doesn't compare to Zach's beach days..
Tyson Amundsen
why do you hate us eddy
Edward Ekstrom
I am with you, I love you.
Brayden Haws
Lick a butt eddy
Edward Ekstrom
Haha so much anger.
Let me explain myself.
I know this is hard to believe but I hardly ever see my wife during the week. I'm taking 15 credits of straight 400 level CS classes and working 20+ hours a week.
Your stupid little physics class doesn't hold a candle to my easiest class.
Fact
And so when I have free time, Annie likes to hang out us two alright!
I've already had 2 labs due as well so you can't say I'm not busy at the beginning of the semester.
Over Christmas break both my sister's were in town which only happens once a year and then we went to visit Annie's family
Merit Egan
I'm also busy with effing school tyson. 18 credits of 300 and 400 classes and working. So effffffff you tyson!!!!!!! Efffffffff you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Edward Ekstrom
And I have suggested countless times that we find an online game that I can play with you guys, but it just doesn't happen.
Merit Egan
I didn't mean that.
Edward Ekstrom
But I understand!
Merit Egan
Eddy, are you in st g?
Edward Ekstrom
So now do you see my side Tyson
I'm going to st g after my 3:00 class
I second merits efff uuuu vox
Merit Egan
We be in the warmth as we googlevox
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Merit Egan
I do still have time for fifa
Always
Edward Ekstrom
And jaws, I didn't expect that luck a butt comment from you. Tyson, maybe.. but NOT YOU!
Tyson Amundsen
If you guys think we wanted this many voxes you're wrong. And eddy you must have the hardest life on planet earth
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, #lovelifeasis
Merit Egan
How many times will your phone buzz in the next 2 minutes? Use physics to figure it out.

Edward Ekstrom
What does pinpoint do?
Merit Egan
It shows right where you are to the people you allow
So I see talmage is at work, not just sandy
Edward Ekstrom
Does it use gps? If so that will be a battery drain
Merit Egan
It does not
My gps is off
I didn't notice any battery life difference. If you do you can turn it off and I won't be mad
Edward Ekstrom
Aight
Colby Condie
Holy shiz that was a ton of google voxes. I wasn't sure if it was my phone or if someone slipped a vibrating sex toy in my pocket. #takeiteasy

Guys watch part of this interview that Richard Sherman had with Skip Bayless and Stephen A on First Take
It was last year
He's crazy
Merit Egan
Haha what the heck. He just insults him over and over.
Tyson Amundsen
somehow I remember this interview. But I would not have been able to connect the dots between it and last night
Colby Condie
"Skip, in my 24 years of life, I'm better at life than you."
Tyson Amundsen
Haha it sounded like skip had been criticizing RS for not being as good as the others as well as talking too much. Which I think was RS motivation to throw down
Brayden Haws
Yeah skip is super annoying, usually way opinionated without having facts to back it up, I was glad when Sherman threw down on him
Bryan Samuelson
I think they're both idiots
Colby Condie
Yeah I don't usually agree with Skip but this was just RS going off I think. I think Skip said he wasn't the best DB in the league and he insulted Skip
John Sherwood
So are we skiing today?
Teez
Tyson Amundsen
John I'm going, I hope you join. I hope you all join, no reason not to
Tyson Amundsen
Colby come ski today? John what's your status currently
John Sherwood
I'm coming
I'll be over at 215
Colby Condie
I think I may. Depending on what I can get done today. But I'll probably come regardless
Tyson Amundsen
Excellent, both of you.
Tyson Amundsen
We got Seth. Colby are you with us?
Edward Ekstrom
Why should you always walk a mile in a man's shoes before you insult him?
Brayden Haws
Cause then you're a mile away, and you got his shoes

Bryan Samuelson
I want that
Edward Ekstrom
Haha that would be too many brackets to store on a computer..
John Sherwood
Let's use googles computers
Merit Egan
We should find the 100 most likely and them each enter like 15
Edward Ekstrom
That would be good, is there a cap?
For how many you can enter?
Because I was thinking we'd have to enter the top 10 billion most likely to actually have a shot at getting it right
Merit Egan
nope, no cap. Just on ESPN
There are 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 possible brackets

Let's make a pact right now, that if any of us win, we will share 1M a year with each other

Entrance fee to be in the company: be in this chat
And if Gomez wants to be in the company he has to pay us all 1 million and doesn't get any rewards. He does all the hard dirty work for us. Like cook and clean while we FEEF

Upon further review, the ruling on the field has been overturned- facial fracture confirmed. Had a specialist appt, I'm going back for a CT scan. Doesn't appear to be serious but just needs to be checked.

Same with ju. She snowboards but doesn't ski. Just has a learners permit

I would have to do some digging to see if I still have skis. For it has been years and years. I estimate 9 years since I last hit the slopes. Does that relegate me to a learners permit? Prior to those 9 years I had a season pass for years. Suddenly it ended. Please, help categorize me.
John Sherwood
Oh no. You have a license to skill. (Ski and kill. And skill. Triple)
Merit Egan
I like those licenses. Very much so.
Kelli's old branch?
John Sherwood
You know it
Merit Egan
Good Branch
Edward Ekstrom
Annie snowboards to, it doesn't translate for girls
John Sherwood
We'll have a couple of beginners. That's perfect. It'll be fun
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
Was Mitt good?
Edward Ekstrom
Kind of boring
but good.
Annie and I didn't think it was boring, but I've heard from others that they thought it was boring.
You'll have to ask al
Colby Condie
I'm here for the video call
Edward Ekstrom
colby, can I borrow your alta pass
so it only costs 5$
instead of 10$
Colby Condie
I think that means I can't go as well
️
Merit Egan
Let's cut the pass in half and let each of you take half
Colby Condie
No I will give it to eddy. I would rather have some one use it then my money to go to waste. For I hath not the desire to bear these burdens
I'm the true owner
Edward Ekstrom
Oh I didn't know you were coming
Colby Condie
Still come eddy
John still has another to go in his meeting
*another hour
Bryan Samuelson
John I also had a church meeting this morning. Meetings on Saturdays? A nothing sacred anymore?
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Does anyone else have two passes?
That we could borrow?
How late can we go until?
John, what kind of meeting are you in?
Just the quorum of the twelve, meeting for 10 hours
John Sherwood
Mingles committee meeting. My co chair is satan. Hard to get heavenly things done
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
When does the chair stop?
Merit Egan
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Merit and kel, come!
John Sherwood

She used to snowboard
Merit Egan
Ummmm, let me see
Edward Ekstrom
Yea!
Tyson, how long will you be?
John Sherwood
Is tys at snowbird?
Edward Ekstrom
I think so
Alex Platis
Mitt was pretty boring. The concept was more interesting than the execution, mostly because Mitt is just a boring guy. Kind and smart, but boring.
Saturday, January 25, 2014 4:38 PM
Merit Egan
That's a tough slope John.
Colby Condie
Haha merit help me figure out my location sharing at dinner tonight

Tyson Amundsen
"We are past the point of needing or wanting you to understand, it is clear that the tears, heartache and devastation do not speak to your hearts," she said, addressing opponents of same-sex marriage. "We are past the point of civility, as calling us unnatural, asking us to stifle our love and promoting only one type of family as traditional is beyond being civil."

Gay people hate us.
Except for that one gay guy who wanted to date me.

John Sherwood
Would anyone be down to bowl or something tonight? Or a game night?
Merit Egan
I would but I have school until freaking gay freaking 10pm MST. At least I don't have school until 10pm Colby Standard Time. I'd be there forever.
John Sherwood
Or bring a game to bowling. Jenga. Draw a plank, bowl that plank
Merit Egan
will this start post 10pm?
Edward Ekstrom
Have you guys played aquire?
It's awesome.
Brayden Haws
have you played happy jump? its awesome
Edward Ekstrom
Nope
Acquire it's cooler
Colby Condie
May I be so bold in requesting to all members of 'X' that we propose a change: BST (Bryan Standard Time) due to recent events.

-last one to show up at Mimi's dinner
Merit the patriarch must approve my request first, of course
Merit Egan
It has made the ballot and I put it out to vote
1= Keep CST
2=Change to BST
3=Eliminate all fake time zones
All ballots must be cast by 6pm MST
Tyson Amundsen
I propose we remove option 3 from the ballot
Brayden Haws
i vote 1, colby is always late, bryan was late once, those are not equivilant
Merit Egan
motion followed
no option 3
1=Keep CST
2=Change to BST
Bryan Samuelson
I apologize for my tardiness to Mimi's. It was unacceptable and a slap in the face to Kasey and all 'X' members who had sacrificed their individual pursuits to arrive at the pre-ordained time. I accept full responsibility for my actions, and am determined not to betray your trust again. However, I cannot support the movement to change CST to BST
Merit Egan
2 votes for CST
0 votes for BST
John Sherwood
Ju and I vote for option 1. I have a power of attorney for julia thus the vote is valid. Unless the poll is for 'X' members
Merit Egan
Counselors, who are the valid voters?
John Sherwood
I, being a counselor, support either decision counselors.
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan

We do appreciate Colby making an effort to change. Our April banquet feature Colby as a strong candidate for most improved 'X' award
Brayden Haws

Taking a break from physics
Merit Egan
Haws will also be put on trial for suspension at our quarterly review.
John Sherwood
Haws is making a case for dirtiest jokes in our april banquet
Brayden Haws
Guys don't punish me for teaching science
zach fackrell
Let's play poker
John Sherwood
I'd play
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
1, Bryan convinced me with his well thought out essay
Also, I motion to block John's inclusion of women votes. That is highly unorthodox.
Merit Egan
True, women can't vote. Next thing they'll start saying they should be able to own land.
John Sherwood
One vote for 1
Colby Condie
Hahahaha Tyson I laughed out loud at your diagram. Literally

Well I guess I can still cast my vote for 2. My vote is coming a bit late though. CST timing
Merit Egan
I vote for 2, just to keep it interesting.
4 votes for CST
2 votes for BST
Colby Condie
Also at the quarterly review, we must instruct Tyson that the correct spelling is "tardies" and not "tardys"
Merit Egan

zach fackrell

also i vote for 1
Merit Egan
5 vs. 2
6 votes seals it
Brayden Haws
The fact that Colby's vote was late seals it
Tyson Amundsen
I don't know that my vote was officially counted, I vote to defend traditional time zones: CST
All in all, I'm pleased with colbys current trajectory. By my graph, I expect he will be close to the acceptable range of tardies in a few short months
Brayden Haws
Or years
Tyson Amundsen
The slope is exponential, thus allowing for rapid improvement. Every saint has a past, every sinner has a future
The stage is set for Comeback Colby
Merit Egan
There is an express course offered, where we give you 3 locations and times a day for 1 week. Upon successful and timely arrival, you will graduate and officially re-enter the traditional time zone.
Brayden Haws
Merit will track all of this with his NSA google app
Merit Egan
Save your receipts for gasoline reimbursement.
Yes I will.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha guys! Jimmy Fallon's hashtag game. The hashtag is #mydumbinjury, I can totally win this. I wanna get on the show
We all need to tweet my injuries to him. And bryans hands.
Colby Condie
Alas. According to Tyson's expert diagram, by the year 2016 the average number of tardies per fiscal year for Bryan and I will cross paths. At which time, I will reopen my request for BST.
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Make sure they are funny or they won't get on
Merit Egan
I feel like that was rude
I will make them more funny
Tyson Amundsen
From me to you? That may be true, I honestly didn't read your tweets completely I just saw it was happening and had to get my last thought out
Props to the Patriarch for setting an ensample for us

Haha, unlikely Sloan ever posed like that.

I was at some art studio downtown location scouring for a sweet project in filming next week
Scouting
Merit Egan
Try to get in and film Jerry Sloan's banner ceremony at the Jazz game on Friday. It's a big deal
This is the worst. If the effing Lakers get a top 3 pick and we don't...
Alex Crawford
In response to Tyson's comments on gay marriage. You all should watch this. Excellent commentary on the new for traditional families. http://youtu.be/z2cgYPFzXj8
Tyson Amundsen
I'll watch that
Alex Crawford
Let me know what you think of it.
Tyson Amundsen
Lot of really good things in there
The Heritage Foundation is a solid organization
I liked that guy
Alex Crawford
Right? At least 66% of utah feels the same way. How is that possible that only 66 percent approved the amendment if more than that percent are Mormon and not all Mormons are for gay marriage.
Tyson Amundsen
Well idk if more than 66% statewide are Mormon. But in any kind of political issue, 66% is a big majority. The best point he has IMO is that marriage is defined as a man/woman. Those that want equality by having gay marriage will never get it even if it becomes legal, because woman/woman simply cannot equal man/women
Will never get equality I mean
It's political calculus
Merit Egan changed the topic to Los Alamos
Colby Condie
Moral of the story: women shouldn't vote
Wednesday, January 29, 2014 11:59 PM

I think we should all fill this out for the super bowl. Among some bets are: if bruno mars will be wearing a fedora. If the national anthem is over 2 minutes 24 seconds and if erin andrews will interview Richard sherman
And which color the gatorade will be when they dump it on the coach
Brayden Haws
Haha dood prop bets are the best
Colby Condie
Everyone wager $1000
Wits and wagers

Brayden Haws
Ours is like $110 for both our cars
Edward Ekstrom
Okay cool.
Alex Crawford
I just got a quote for $74/mo for full coverage on one and just liability on the other. I currently pay just 32/mo for liability only.
74 was for 2 cars obviously
Edward Ekstrom
Okay thanks guys
Guys, one of you should double major in cs so we can start a company.
Any takers?
Merit, your phone is basically a computer. How about you?
Merit Egan
I'll start a company with you. I'll be the Marketing SVP
Edward Ekstrom
Okay, but we need one more developer.
Let's hire Mark Zuckerburg
I hear he's good
Merit Egan
Nah, he'll just want to introduce "pokes" into our company....
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Alex Crawford
Eddy, do I really even need to go to class at a university or can I pick it up somewhere else?
I'd love to learn to program.
Edward Ekstrom
I think if you're extremely dedicated you can pick it up.
John Sherwood
I thought you do program crawdad? And did you hear of that homeless black guy programming?
Alex Crawford
I only know I tiny bit of syntax and theory. I wrote a simple program to control a lab setup but that's about as far as I go. Who's this black guy? Never heard of him.
John Sherwood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bc9sho17ro&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Edward Ekstrom
If he can learn, so can you alex.
Alex Crawford
I'm sold. I'll have to look into it after I graduate.

Real Life. It's worth less than a penny a share, so I own like 40,000 shares. Haha
John Sherwood
What stock is it? Is it for work?
Merit Egan
No, Connor recommended I buy it. I only put 190 towards it, but it's now worth like 280.
Tyson Amundsen
Sell 'em
Merit Egan
Hopefully it keeps going up
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Don't okay poker without me

Or just go to the match
zach fackrell
Haha Such as. The Iran
I vote poker and game simultaneous
Merit Egan
Yeah. The game would require an immedialeave
John Sherwood
Isn't the game at 830?

Edward Ekstrom
Good.
John Sherwood

It doesn't let you buy stock under $1. That's weird if it wouldn't let you buy 3$ stock
John Sherwood
I tried again and it let me. Stranger danger
Merit Egan
System malfunction
Colby Condie
So what would be an example of stock price limit
Merit Egan
You don't have to do that. I'm not exactly sure. It's when you want to buy it or sell it when it hits a certain price. If you just select market it buys it right then.

The Sawgrass Marriott hotel. Apparently this is a good golf course. I wouldn't know.

Oh yes. TPC Sawgrass. Site of the Players Championship. PGA tournament. Check out the 17th hole. Arguable the most unique hole in the world
Merit Egan
Yes the island hole. Classic. How much is a round? Should I sneak out and play the 17th?
Colby Condie
Do it. Just don't get arrested
You should tour the course though if they let you. Sometimes you can just walk the course
John Sherwood
That's be awesome. Its 375 with a cart to play merit. Chump change
Put it on the company credit card.

Nonpartisan evidence that Obamacare implicitly taxes additional work.
I don't mean evidence.

I just witnessed a lady smash into the 7-11 on 90th!! She drove her car through the front window and then tried to flee the scene. I pulled over and started chasing after her cause no one else was doing anything. I ran after her with my voice memo recording everything that was happening. She confessed to everything and asked for my help to hide from the cops. She had an open beer can and told me she was in the military and refused to go back to the 7-11. She was just gonna leave the car and hideout and try to make it back to California. Another lady from 7-11 caught up to is in her car and then the suspect told me that she's pay me if I helped her escape and if I knocked the driver out. The cops caught up to is after 10 minutes of running through back neighborhoods and then took my statement and I have them the recording. Then we went back and found the beer can she tried to ditch.

zach fackrell
When I told then I recorded the whole incident they were like."wait what? You recorded yourself asking her questions as you ran? Dang man that's some quick thinking! Good job."
Then another officer recognized me cause he had pulled me over just last week for a broken headlight. I asked if I could get some future speeding pardon. They didn't think it was a funny request

zach fackrell
haha she didnt say her beer went flat .. i was just quoting that song i made up that one time.
when she realized she still had her beer. and i pointed it out to her she threw it on the side of the road
than after the craziness died down i went back with the cops and we found the can
then
I was hoping to get on the news like mr sherwood
Edward Ekstrom
I meant I bet they didn't like that you told her to toss her beer, I figured she didn't quote your country song hags

Zach I think you stumbled upon something much bigger than a 711 crash. An army woman of 18 years in California with 3 kids? Seems to neat.. I think this has nothing to do with janice valdez and everything to do with ralph Nader
On an unrelated note: I've been watching a ton of breaking bad and conspiracy theories
So who wants to do the 'senses' date for valentines?
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
zach fackrell
yessssss
Colby Condie
NWA: no whites allowed. Ha good haws.

Niggaz wit attitude
Also, just got off work. Time to go to my next job. Italian teaching.

Tyson Amundsen
Dang. Shaun White is cool and a good guy, I wish he'd have won
Colby Condie
Me too. Can't win em all
Bryan Samuelson
Was that luge girl that was pop lock'n droppin the one from BYU?
zach fackrell
She got kicked out of BYU for dancing like that
Colby Condie
Haha
And idk Bryan..
Bryan Samuelson
Kicked outta byu!!!! She can come to the U and party with me, I'll teach her the stanky legg
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
Bryan, her coming to learn dance moves from you is like Jesus going to be baptized of John
Colby Condie
Zeezr inching closer to 100.. Ayooo. I had to erase that game cause I was gettin so ticked
Hahaha great Tyson
Merit Egan
You c can never get it back Colb. It's of the market
Colby Condie
How come?
I just checked and you're absolutely right merit. *he's absolutely right*
zach fackrell
The app inventor took it off the market
Merit Egan
The guy who made it didn't like how people treated him. He got to famous
He was making $50,000 a day.
zach fackrell
My brother put his phone on eBay with the game still installed and people were bidding up to $90,000 for it! Then eBay took it off cause it's illegal to sell phones without apps still installed
With
Merit Egan
Crazy. People think it was a marketing tactic by him. The game got millions more downloads after his announcement and is probably making him way more than it would have. All the ads are still getting him money.
Colby Condie
That's a ton of money. Just for a stupid simple game
Tyson Amundsen
The bigger issue here is clearly the dancing luge babe
Merit Egan
Tyson hates everything we talk about.
John Sherwood
He does. Maybe this will sparq his interest. Let's do a mid week spring break trip
I cant do a full week. But I can do the latter part of the week. The 12-16?
Tyson Amundsen
Like a Zach style or teezer style? And by that I mean like a cruise or like camping
Merit Egan
I'm going to Disney land.
John Sherwood
Zach is going on a cruise already. I want to go to st gee or something
Colby Condie
I'm still deciding if I'm going to AZ again with my dad. But I wanna do a friend trip regardless at some point

Preposterous
zach fackrell
Gross
Colby Condie
My condolences
John Sherwood
St g colb
Golf and tennis and hiking
Colby Condie
Yes and yes and yes
️️️
John Sherwood
Only in st gee
Not in az
Bryan Samuelson
John I like the trip idea. I really do. But I don think I can come cuz I will be at the PAC 12 tourney with my padres. Potentially I could meet up with you guys for a day or so? Potentially
John Sherwood
That's Vegas right bsam?
I do want to see Celine
....
Bryan Samuelson
Yep. Haha yeah dude, just make the jaunt down
If you were at all serious about
Coming to Vegas, I highly recommend it. It was super fun last year
John Sherwood
That would be awesome.. is there just a day pass for the games? Or like a two have pass?
Game*
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah the tickets are sold by sessions, which are two games each.
John Sherwood
How pricey?
Bryan Samuelson
Right now they have these voucher things which are $37 per session. So two games for 37
Colby Condie
That's pretty good. Cheaper than the elite eight games I went to in Phoenix. Session was 2 games as well and it was $100 per session
Wednesday, February 12, 2014 11:09 AM

Tyson Amundsen
a message to whoever comes to that room in the Institute next
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
To begin my nightly Olympic commentary, I'd like to point out that the top Russian figure skating pair's guy looks like Zlatan Ibrahimovic
Merit Egan
Tyson only talks about the olympics
Merit Egan left the conversation
Tyson Amundsen
I also feel like the US is slightly behind in the medal count
Haha yes
Brayden Haws
Merit you just hate everything Tyson talks about
Tyson Amundsen
Although still not interested in fantasy stock, I will contribute this
John Sherwood
It's a knowledgeable simulation teezer. American problems
I always took you as a sponge for information
Tyson Amundsen
I definitely am, but I don't have knowledgeable simulations til next trimester
Merit Egan joined the conversation
Tyson Amundsen
Merit did you see Jimmer tonight? #peaceoffering
Did anyone hear about it for that matter. He had the green thumb
Merit Egan
Good peace offering. Good to see Jimmermania back in action.
Tyson Amundsen
It was good. If there's one thing I love its good 3 point shooting. And he was dialing long distance
Merit let talk about hit family. I see your mom at the institute like once a week, its awesome
Hit= your
Merit Egan
That is good. Tell her I'm doing good.
Tyson Amundsen
I'll do that, she's at the service corner so I'll see if she can knit you a hat or something.
Erstwhile, is talmage going to be the next to go deep with a West J?
Brayden Haws
I haven't seen your mother at all this semester, I used to all the time last semester
zach fackrell
Dude teez they broke up
Tyson Amundsen
#toosoonteez
That would also be my Asian name if I was in the Olympics
John Sherwood
Mine would be john sherwood
Or transpose my last 2 letters. Sherwodo
Colby Condie
Speaking of Asians, there was a Taiwanese lady who I helped at the bank today. Spoke terrible English. She had some tricky questions so I brought over the personal banker at the branch (who is also Asian) to help decipher. I was lol'ing in my head the whole time. #asianpersuasion
They were both speaking English with way heavy Asian accents. Two women, two countries, one continent under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all

Olympic update: preparing to watch mens slopestyle skiing, which I predict to be one of the coolest events of the entire Olympics
Bryan, I can confirm that Jake did indeed date Torah Bright
Merit Egan
Stock update. I'm doing terrible.

I think they're cool. They have a subtle pinstripe, classy. I'll probably get one when they release them
Tyson Amundsen

Hot shiz that's sweet. Usually bagpipe lessons cost a ton

Tyson Amundsen
Haha righteous
John Sherwood
To everyone. Ice skating at 9 at cottonwood heights. Bring a gal. Bring a friend. Bring yourself. All valid
Tyson Amundsen
The gayest uniform of men's figure skating definitely goes to Japan. However, our USA skater is undoubtedly the most gay of all
That gayness corresponds with men's figure skating comes as no surprise
Merit Egan
Feef Tomorrow?
Afternoon
John Sherwood
Feer. Yup
Feef
Saturday, February 15, 2014 10:35 AM
Merit Egan
11 o'clock fifa?
Tyson Amundsen
I'm awake, but I don't think I can feef today
Merit Egan
I don't even want to
Brayden Haws
I won't be home
Tyson Amundsen

I just summarized last night, Haws edition #partyboar
John Sherwood
I want ti feef. But a little later. Boys, I woke up at 530 this morn to view the usa men's hockey. What an amazing game
8 penalty shots
Oshi
Took 6 of them
Tyson Amundsen
Will it be on prime time later? I wanna watch it
zach fackrell
Poo is good
Colby Condie
I heard all about it but didn't watch
Tyson Amundsen
Anyone available to party tonight?
I'm going to attempt indoor soccer at 520 and then making party after
John Sherwood
Merit let's feef
Merit Egan
Tonight feef?
Brayden Haws
I'm available to party
John Sherwood
Afternoon feef. 3
Merit Egan
Stand by for more peeps and possible 3 pm MST feef.
John Sherwood
Colb haws bsam?
Bryan Samuelson
I would like to feef, but at 3 I'll be watching Utah-UCLA
Merit Egan
Not as important bsam.
Bryan Samuelson
They're both very important parts of my life. Wisdom and order
John Sherwood
Colb and higgs?
Brayden Haws
We're doing stuff with my fam as of now but later I can party
Colby Condie
I'm goin to a movie with Minni and her folks at 4.
Edward Ekstrom
I'm popping.
What ever happened to our rule that we always have to announce on the Google vox when we pooh?
Merit Egan
Tyson threatened to leave if we talked about anything other than the Olympics and soccer. Poop was included.
Tyson Amundsen
Strike that from the record- poop is an officially sanctioned topic
Brayden Haws
Eddy I'm going to china grill tonight, wanna come?
Edward Ekstrom
We're in Phoenix.
Brayden Haws
Anyone gonna party tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
As I've previously stated, that's not a good question Haws. Level 1 question I'd wager. We're obviously partying, come to my house
Colby Condie
The battle is heating up. Haws what do you have to say to Tyson?
Brayden Haws
I feel like Tyson is correct in saying that we always have a partying mindset, but I don't think it's a dumb questions cause we don't always act on that mindset
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe not we collectively, but I personally do. So maybe it is a good question on this forum to see if as a group we are partying. Individuallly its a different question
Brayden Haws
Nevertheless me and Teezr are best pals so we never battle
Except battle people who want to mess with us
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah, like those da** communists
Sunday, February 16, 2014 11:38 AM
Colby Condie
Just took a massive poop
Edward Ekstrom
Popping
Let's go to dinner this coming weekend Haws. You, me and it women.
Brayden Haws
Eddy I would love to, I thought you'd never ask
Colby Condie
Eddy where's my invite? Or is only for Xcerpt presidency?
My bum is on the Swedish
Merit Egan
I haven't been invited either.
My bum is all alone, my bum is all alone
Edward Ekstrom
I just wanted to ask Haws since Annie and I couldn't go yesterday.
But you guys are welcome of course
Any and all
Brayden Haws
In a past life me and eddy were lovers, we need a date night
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom
My boobs have shrunk a lot lately.
Merit Egan


Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
May Bode Miller bring us glory
Bsam you watching this? I used to dislike bode cuz he was the best but also occasionally arrogant. Like a toned down version of rasheed Wallace
Except better. I need a better comparison. Crawdad?
Bryan Samuelson
Dangit
Brayden Haws
Haha eddy I just saw all of those, they're amazing, saved em all
Merit great work on those
Tyson Amundsen
I hate that they stick the camera right in the athletes faces right after something bad happens. Give em some freaking privacy
Brayden Haws
How'd you make those?
Photoshop? Paint?
Tyson Amundsen
Also, merit does work #truth
Colby Condie
That interview with Bode was terrible. Give the guy some privacy
Tyson Amundsen
Seriously. Reporters can be idiots. How many times did she ask the same question
Merit Egan
The note 3 stylus allows you to draw around anything and copy it, then I put it on top of other pictures in the sketchbook app.
Bryan Samuelson
For serious. We paused it and fast forwarded She's just trying to make a name for herself, no matter how many friends she loses e people she leaves dead and bloodied along the way
Tyson Amundsen
How come someone in the network can't realize how annoying we all find it?
Merit Egan
I missed it. Did they ask him about his brother? Dug too deep?
Colby Condie
Haha yes Bryan.
Tyson Amundsen
Merit they asked him like four times in a row, same question
I wish someone would go Richard Sherman and yell at the reporter
Colby Condie
The interview ended because he was crying too much to speak. That's when you know the reporter sucks
Bryan Samuelson
I feel like that's exactly what she wanted to happen, which make me mad
Brayden Haws
The US shoulda sent Sherman as a delegate to deal with the media
Merit Egan
I can't find a link. If you find one, post it.
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, question.
What's the kids name who was in our stake and friends with kenny and all of those year older kids?
He's short.
Smiley
Usually buzzed hair
He's on the plane with me and I forgot his name
Hurry
Send a pic from Facebook too so I can be sure
C'mon!
Help a brother out
Bryan Samuelson
I just don't know. I can't think of who that would be
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff
Annie got it
Don't remember his last name
Tyson Amundsen
John can you get Scotts pass and ski tomo?
Merit Egan
Jeff S.
Edward Ekstrom
What's the s?
Merit Egan
Maybe not.
John Sherwood

Merit Egan
Negatory on the school
Brayden Haws
No school
John Sherwood

Brayden Haws
Al looks happy
Edward Ekstrom
The infamous first hole at Old Mill.
Colby Condie
Al loves photos
Alex Platis
Freak you Haws
Bryan Samuelson
Al are you aware that John's dad's name is Al? He is the one pictured
Edward Ekstrom
Haha even if you thought he was talking about you Al, why would "Al looks happy" invoke such rage?
Brayden Haws
I just saw a guy bench 500 lbs
3 reps
Merit Egan
Sorry I didn't say hi.
Edward Ekstrom
Oh merit you saw was when you guys were watching me bench?
saw Haws*
Merit Egan
Yeah I was the guy at the other bench doing the 500. Were you the kid doing 500 too? We're buff.
Remember when Jeff wanted us to lift weights. He didn't believe in us, but look at us now.
Brayden Haws
Did you guys see me? I was that guy doing the 10 pounds
John Sherwood

I think when saying scrotum. You don't need to say sac after
Merit Egan
Haha very true indeed. That's like saying wiener ding dong.
Colby Condie
Al voxes once a month and it's always in rage
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah Merit, we're way buffer than Jeff could ever hope to be.  And Haws, you meant 1,000lbs right?
John, What'd you shoot?
John Sherwood
40. Pushed everything right but short game saved me
Alex Platis
I thought haws was saying that I look like I'm 50. Which is true, but I don't need to hear that.
Colby Condie

Nonsense.
Edward Ekstrom
I see, don't put yourself down like that Al.  You're a sexy bachelor living in LA.  Not an old man.
Tyson Amundsen
#GhettoJeopardy is trending. It's awesome but mostly too far over my news, even with my LA experiences.
And by news I mean head
Brayden Haws
Haha yeah I was looking at those and I has no clue what was going on
Tyson Amundsen
Think how entertaining it would be to actually play that
Colby Condie
Haha I was just reading some of those

I'm wearing the same thing on this birthday
Edward Ekstrom
The big ONE SIX.  Stay off the roads everyone!
Tyson Amundsen
Ayooo Heezer!
Merit Egan

HAPPY BIRTHDAY HIGGINS
Brayden Haws
In honor of my birthday I motion that we play poker this weekend
Merit Egan
here here
Tyson Amundsen
I have to pee SO bad right now
Colby Condie
Tyson we only want to hear poop updates
Tyson Amundsen
However, when I have to pee this bad if I sit down on the pot there's a good chance I'll get poo as well. When you have to do one real bad the other often occurs
Like a companionship
Brayden Haws
That's true. Sometimes when you gotta number two real bad but you don't have time, you can throw a whiz and it helps relieve a lot of the tension
Merit Egan
When is there not time for a number 2?
Brayden Haws
Like if you have to give a presentation in class but you're running late, it can buy you time
Merit Egan
point taken. very good haws.
Brayden Haws
In reality merit you're correct, I was more just trying to show the connection of the systems. I try to spend half my time at work using the bathroom
Merit Egan
We were both right. Surely there are time that require a bid for more time, rather than the full deed being done right then. You can't drop a bomb in motor home with all your in laws, but you can take a leak to get you to the next rest stop.
Brayden Haws

Merit wins the Quicken Loans Vox of the Day
Colby Condie
Today is also the birthday of :

Dr Dre
John Travolta
Yoko Ono

You're in great company Heezr.
Merit Egan
yes, Yoko Ono, one of the great american speed skaters.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Close enough merit
Merit Egan
haha
also ruined the beatles. Quite a diverse person who had changed sexes on occasion
Colby Condie
And I never liked her goatee/sole patch thing
Brayden Haws
Last year I tweeted dr dre like twenty times trying to get some free beats
Merit Egan
She/he does like subway
Brayden Haws
I'm gonna do it again right now
Colby Condie
Tweet at Travolta too
Maybe he can give you some free tickets to the play Grease
Brayden Haws
Grease is my second favorite musical after Annie
Colby Condie
Mine is Nutcracker. Just cause I respect men who are willing to dance in tights with their junk hangin out
Merit Egan
Colb, you might also like the show in Vegas called the "Thunder Down Under"

Edward Ekstrom
"Which of these 4 would not be allowed: petting the lambs, loving the lambs, feeding the lambs, making lamb chops? "
Brayden Haws
"Have you ever been interested in/committed beastiality?"
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Do you think baby lambs should all be put to death?

What's more important: your own life, or the life of our lambs?

Burned?
Merit Egan
Apparently Jimmer is on the trade block. A 2nd round pick is all it would take apparently. I mean, jimmer isn't great, but I'd give up a 2nd round pick.
Tyson Amundsen
I agree. Make the call merit
Merit Egan
Jazz stood pat. I'm ok with it. Pacers made a good move I think.
Tyson Amundsen
They got him?
Merit Egan
No, they traded Danny Granger for Evan Turner and someone else
Brayden Haws
That's good bench scoring for them, and a help if they lose Stevenson

http://www.ksl.com/?sid=28786547&nid=1016&title=religious-freedom-bill-riles-gay-rights-supporters&fm=home_page&s_cid=queue-10
Thats a bill that is passing in Arizona. The bill is designed to protect religious freedom of businesses by allowing them to refuse service to gays if it conflicts with their religious beliefs.
Democrats say its discrimination. Republicans cite a case of a photographer being sued because he refused to take wedding pics of a gay couple, and a baker being sued because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding
Edward Ekstrom
State house of representatives
Jk senate
Tyson Amundsen
The vote split straight down the party line. so if he's republican he voted for it
Edward Ekstrom
Good
Tyson Amundsen
Which is how i'd vote
Edward Ekstrom
He's repub
We are the grand ol party. What a cool name
Tyson Amundsen
yeah its a good thing
Brayden Haws
Lets feef tonight
Merit

zach fackrell
Does anyone have an oldish retro/ vintage style car I can use for a video shoot tomorrow? Or know anyone who does?... Jeeps or broncos. Something with a summer vibe
Brayden Haws
They don't make xterras anymore, so you could say that's retro
Tyson Amundsen
2000 Honda Odyssey, silver. Absolutely screams summertime
Brayden Haws
Bryan's car is the old Camry body style, so some may say that's vintage
Alex Platis
The blur. RIP
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan himself is pretty vintage
Actually Al likes wine and old movies with Audrie Hepburn and stuff. Al is the most vintage
Alex Platis
Bryan's last Latina chick was vintage. She was like 28.
Tyson, I prefer Katherine Hepburn
Brayden Haws
I have a shirt from 7th grade
That's retro
Alex Platis
Luke Ensign's views on women are retro. Recruit him.
Edward Ekstrom
We could all take a dumb in an outhouse.. That's retro.
Your old Z was retro, use that.
zach fackrell
Oh man how I miss that Z-bar
John Sherwood
Any plans tonight?
Brayden Haws
Partying

Partying so hard, but not until like 9.
Bryan Samuelson
I get off work in 3 minutes, I'm looking to party hard
Tyson Amundsen
We no longer have the Olympics at my house. I'm looking to rage all night
Colby Condie
Highlight of the day:

Shawn Bradley came to the branch I was working at.
Merit Egan
Was he nice? My brother once saw him at the airport and tried to talk to him and he was rude to Connor. Connor was like 14. #tallman
Tyson Amundsen
Hear Ye hear Ye
Merit, john, come feef? Merit we need your controllers

Merit Egan
I know. Are you going to feef? Can we feef Tomorrow too
Colby Condie
I didn't really talk to him merit. He sat with one of the personal bankers at a desk. I didn't really hear much besides the fist fight that they got into
Tyson Amundsen
Here and now merit
Tyson Amundsen
Haws has been wearing no pants for several hours now
Brayden Haws
Haha obviously I wasn't really coming, I never do
Tyson Amundsen
You're tearin' up my heart

Bryan Samuelson
Duuuuuuudes Steve smith just came into my store
Tyson Amundsen
Like of the Carolina panthers? I hope you didn't swallow your tongue this time
Bryan Samuelson
The same. I didn't get to talk to him at all, I was busy doing other stuff, didn't even get a good look at him. But I overheard my coworker talk to him about my football so after he had left I asked his name. Goodness sakes
Saturday, February 22, 2014 11:01 PM
Colby Condie


Edward Ekstrom
Good call?
Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Tyson and Bryan: moment of truth. Will there be second dates with Sarah and Cami?
Merit Egan
I, as the Patriarch would approve both.
Brayden Haws
Greg oden is starting for the heat today
Tyson will love that he loves all players from decades past
John Sherwood
I also approve if both of them sman and teezr
I like calling bsam sman. #HaloDaze
#HaloDays
Both apply
Edward Ekstrom
Haha, Sman.
that's my brother-in-law's nick name.  And Bryan's halo character.
Bryan Samuelson
I do plan on asking Sarah out again, especially now that I have approval from the presidency. Ha and sman always make me chuckle
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan, I have not yet approved. As a counselor, I reserve my patriarchal given right to veto Sarah's approval upon meeting her.
Brayden Haws
I also have yet to meet her, so do I like her? I don't know
Edward Ekstrom
Great point Haws.
Let's hear some chatter in here.
Brayden Haws
Get some chicks on the walls
Edward Ekstrom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHquedWuLaA&feature=youtube_gdata_player
Bryan Samuelson
I'll set up a skype interview betwixt you two and Sarah
Edward Ekstrom
I look forward to it.
Thank you for the fake vox update of the date last night Bryan.
Colby, could you please change your name and user photo in the fake vox.
I don't appreciate the identity theft.
Tyson Amundsen
The two voxes have come together: the stick of Google and the stick of vox becoming one in our hands
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Also many thanks to the Xcerpt conglomerate for including my date, your wives talked to her and stuff which was a feel good vibe that she appreciated
Edward Ekstrom
"If architects built buildings the way programmers built software, the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization."

Tyson Amundsen
I feel like you should disagree with that quote. But its funny
Edward Ekstrom
I neither agree nor disagree.
I hate doing homework on Sundays.
but I always put it off until Sunday..
Edward Ekstrom
My class' google group thread gets this Translate message to English
I tried

r = requests.get(self.url, params={'Range':'bytes=0-10'})
print r.text

But r.text still contains the whole html file
Translate message to English
I tried

r = requests.get(self.url, params={'Range':'bytes=0-10'})

But r.text still contains the whole html file
Google want's to translate how we talk to each other to english.
Tyson Amundsen

A leak of what might be the USA away jersey for the world cup

Goottt. Triple T's up in this b
John Sherwood
California condor.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Bryan Samuelson
Colb you look a little weird
Edward Ekstrom
John, tell us about life after graduation.
Is it a dream?
And how did that interview go?
John Sherwood
Aesthetic bird
It's great having no homework. But it sucks searching for jobs. Jobs that pay well
Edward Ekstrom
I see.
Did you interview with that big wig company?
John Sherwood
Not yet. Hopefully 'yet' is accurate
Edward Ekstrom
Got it.
Edward Ekstrom
Just finished a sweet project.  It accelerates downloads of big files.
It opens up however many threads you want with a server, asks how long the file is then each thread downloads 1/n of the file and puts it all back together for you.
threads=connections
John Sherwood
So the bigger the file, the shorter amount of time?
1/n?
Edward Ekstrom
No n=number of threads
so if the file is 10 gigs long and you want 10 threads
each thread will download 1 gig
but they will all download at the same time.
John Sherwood
Oh I see. Wow that's sweet. First of its kind?
Edward Ekstrom
No, it's not all that useful because it only works with static files.
and only about 1% of the internet is static files.
John Sherwood
Write a code like flappy birds. That's only got to be like 30 lines of code right? Millions of muns
Edward Ekstrom
Haha okay
Merit Egan
Zach on YouTube back in the day.
John Sherwood
Bsam teez. You didn't answer. Second date?? Also give an xcerpt on what you are thinking in that depot
Bryan Samuelson
Yes second date for me. Not really sure what the plan is, but may include dropping our paratroopers from a great height
John Sherwood
Initiating pree manoctra?
Bryan Samuelson
Haha we shall see
Tyson Amundsen
By depot you mean department I assume. I think I'd like to do a second. Idk when, maybe this week or maybe not. I also have interest in other pots
John Sherwood
Very good. I thoroughly enjoyed our time together yesterday. Come one come all
Bryan Samuelson
I also enjoyed myself last night. I daresay it was thoroughly enjoyable
Tyson Amundsen
Guys last night was awesome. I love our friends, I love roller derby, I love TRON and plinko
In fact I wish I could frequent nickel mania more often. I need to spend more time gaming on some of those classics
Monday, February 24, 2014 10:25 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Let's do it again soon and so haws and I can come.
Merit Egan
Bach party tonight?
John Sherwood
I'm in
Merit Egan
Where should our location be? My house is always available, yet quite small. Anywhere else?
I also still have colby's root beer float supplies
Bryan Samuelson
Merit we just talked to Leslie at the Institute. What a great lady
Tyson Amundsen
Thou art an elect lady
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Guys its physics
Merit Egan
Teez, bring that gal to the bachelor tonight?
that'll get you to 2nd base for sure
John Sherwood
For sure. I guarantee you'll be entertained
Brayden Haws
He's guaranteed to get SIDS if he goes
Tyson Amundsen
Haha I appreciate the invite, but I don't wanna bypass first base yet. Maybe in the future
John Sherwood
You won't go to second base. You won't go
Colby Condie
She kissed em she killed em. Kate Barlow

Merit Egan
I love that movie
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws
Pet peeve: when there is a way simple, ungraded assignment in class that people take way serious and stress about.
Merit Egan
Haha
Brayden Haws
we had to make a bracelet from pipecleaners and beads based on if we agreed with a statement or not and people were just having a cow
Colby Condie

Alex Crawford
Gentlemen, on behalf of good sport and good times I am pleased to announce a sporting event of epic proportions. You are all invited to an exclusive invitation only ping ping classic. The prize is the most coveted (albeit heretofore unrewarded) ...


Alex Crawford trophy for ping pong greatness.


planned for this Saturday evening, the winner of the classic will take home the trophy as a token of their utmost skill and accomplishment.
Colby Condie
I want that
Alex Crawford
It can be yours if you come out on top.
Tyson Amundsen
dude I'm 100 percent supportive of this initiative. I will be there
Seth Vance
Alex you're a genius!
I'm a little out of practice.. Hope
We have a good warm up round.
How big is the trophy? We need a quarter next to it.
Tyson Amundsen
Seth will you come down?
#askdirectquestions
Seth Vance
Yes.
#commitment
#converted
Tuesday, February 25, 2014 9:57 AM
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Bryan Samuelson
Haha well done merit
Edward Ekstrom
#scaredShizzless
Brayden Haws
Haha merit with the win
Seth Vance
Do you guys have snapchat? Add me: sethvan89
Brayden Haws
Just talked to beau Palmer
Tyson Amundsen
Is he at the U?
Why is he all of a sudden appearing in our discussions, now in our lives?
Brayden Haws
He's shadowing the ortho in our office, he goes to byu
This is all the pole dancers fault
That's why you gotta get with the librarian
Tyson Amundsen
Tell the ortho who he really is
Brayden Haws
Have you guys seen the report of the nba thinking of adding a 4 point line
Colby Condie
What? No I haven't. Post it
Brayden Haws
It was on espn
I'll find it
http://m.espn.go.com/nba/story?storyId=10515372&src=desktop
So basically it was true hoops idea, but the nba confirmed they had already discussed it
Bryan Samuelson
I think that's a dumb idea. Granted, I'm sure people said that about the three point line. But it think it's a dumb idea
Brayden Haws
I agree, I feel like it's too much, too much going on
Edward Ekstrom
I like it.
More comebacks
Colby Condie
Yeah and it's just gonna mess up all the scoring records and everything too.
Seth Vance
I'm an outside shooter, and I don't like it.
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan, why do you think it's a dumb idea?
Merit Egan
I think behind half court should be 4 points. Why not... haha
I don't like a 4 point line
Bryan Samuelson
Ed, basically just what Haws said. Too much going on. And it devalues the 2-point shot too much
#savethemidrange
Edward Ekstrom
Okay then let's make cur 2 worth 4, 3 pointer worth 4 and add a five pointer.
3 pointer worth 5 I mean.
And add a 6
Better yet, have a computer calculate the worth of every bucket based on difficulty.
Bryan Samuelson
Now you're talkin
Seth Vance
Haha people would be coming up with all kinds of hard shots.. Trying to outdo for better point value. That would be entertaining. Haha
Colby Condie
And dunks are worth 7 points. Alley-oops are worth 8
Tyson Amundsen
Foot baskets are game winners, like catching the snitch
Seth Vance
Haha
Colby Condie
Seth you have voxed more in the past day than your whole life combined.
Give us answers
Seth Vance
Turning over a new leaf.
I won't promise pictures of me pooping though...
Tyson Amundsen
All or nothing Seth. #lotswife
Seth Vance
Haha wait, you all post the pants down pooping pics?
I think I only scrolled up far enough to see Colby's.
I stopped when I saw that.

Let's go to as many of these as we can.
Brayden Haws
I would like to say that I helped reactivate Seth
Tyson Amundsen
How do you work that out?
Seth come down and I'll be there
Seth Vance
It's true.
Haws played an important role.
Also Tys, Bryan, those interested, are you getting the college punch pass?#hereforRSL
Tuesday, February 25, 2014 11:00 PM
Colby Condie
Scott Van Pelt has the best avatar in all of Twitter
Merit Egan
Haha I'd never seen that.
Colby Condie
Hahaha yes that's the one merit
Haws I think it's time for me to ask this. Why is your twitter name Brayden Haws-Jenson?
Tyson Amundsen
Seconded
Brayden Haws
Oh I did it as a joke when I got married and forgot to ever change it back
Bryan Samuelson
Personally, I think it's funny
Brayden Haws
The real question is do you stil have your redneck account Colby or did you give up on it?
Colby Condie
I see. Hahahaha I gave up on it. It was dang funny too. But people didn't follow me. And I forgot my password to that account
People didn't see my vision
Brayden Haws
I thought it was funny
Colby Condie
I should revive it
Wednesday, February 26, 2014 10:40 AM
Edward Ekstrom

hump hour in t - 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Bryan Samuelson
Eddy that's inappropriate
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Yeah Bryan.
Sorry for being legally, lawfully, and covenantly married to my wife.
Sorry not sorry.
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good
Edward Ekstrom
Hey everyone with an Android device and a laptop.  Download Open Garden
On both.
Merit Egan
#sorrynotsorry
Edward Ekstrom
and tell me what needs to be improved on it.
Me and my friend are building a better version of Open Garden, and we need to know what needs to improve about it.
Tyson Amundsen
Also, all are invited to do Camp Hobe with me. June 15-20, ultimate partying, most worthwhile thing I've done besides my mission
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
SpaceBallz
Tyson Amundsen
TRON
Merit you're right, arcades are also valuable experiences
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
I'd love to go, I love deal or no deal, but tonight isn't in the cards for me
Merit Egan
let's try this weekend.
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe. Bryan and I are considering the Grizzlies on Friday and Saturday crawdads
Edward Ekstrom
How did we like 'Saving Mr. Banks'?
Colby Condie
I enjoyed it. Slow at times. But a classic story
Brayden Haws
It was good for a one time watch I thought
Colby Condie
Guys I just deposited the largest check I've ever seen in my life
Brayden Haws
Jan brewer vetoed the bill in AZ
Tyson Amundsen
very interesting. I will have to go look it up
Edward Ekstrom
Today someone made a 300$ purchase with our debit card number at a kmart in salt lake.
Colby Condie
Fraud
John Sherwood
Dispute. 5-7 days.
Merit Egan
Do you want me to give you your card back?
Colby Condie
Or we could go buy some more stuff tomorrow merit.
Merit Egan
Scratch my last comment. That sucks someone stole your card. (Colby, let's meet at kmart at 3)
Colby Condie
Yeah I really feel bad for ya Eddy..

*OK merit. same location, same cashier*
Merit Egan
Pin code 6190
Alex Crawford
So the official launch time for the tourney on Saturday is going to be 7:30 pm.
Colby Condie
I will unfortunately be absent. Headed to StG
On Friday
Merit Egan
Eddy is buying the booze. Well, eddy's card is buying the booze.
Colby Condie
Yeah you're right merit. That $300 worth of sour gummy worms and mucho mango probably won't last us through Saturday. Gotta stock up on more
Alex Platis
Tyson the AZ bill was unconstitutional, thanks to precedence set by a Supreme Court case involving Mormons. #ironic
Edward Ekstrom
Could have been due to this. http://m.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/apples-security-bug-what-to-know-about-it-and-what-to-do-about-it/2014/02/24/b59404e4-9d59-11e3-9ba6-800d1192d08b_story.html
John, we already disputed it. Well it go through for sure? Or how do they determine it?
John Sherwood
Ya it'll go through. It goes through our dispute department. I don't know the process they use to see if it's valid or not but when you sign the dispute it says you are responsible for perjury if it's foul play
Thursday, February 27, 2014 3:23 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy I'm coming to you tomo. BYU conference center at 1030
Edward Ekstrom

But I'm actually not coming down til tomo eve.
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, you remind me of a modern day Mr. Darcey.
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not sure thats good. Isn't he the pride half of 'pride & prejudice'? And a real deutsch for most of the book?
Or is it that at the end he ends up with the absolutely bangin' Elizabeth Bennett
Tyson Amundsen
Carter babcock engaged?!
Bryan Samuelson
Wha????
Brayden Haws
Whoa man
Tyson Amundsen
He just posted it. So it could be real

Brayden Haws
Seth bring that home with you tomo
You are my new king
Seth Vance
Dude I will! They're a little harder to use, but still hilarious..
Bryan Samuelson
Great work Seth. Several peeps have printed those at my store. Makes me chuckle every time
Colby Condie
Haha. We could make our own custom deck
Xcerpt version
Seth Vance
Yeah man. It would be hard to come up with better cards though. I can't trump Firing a rifle into the air while balls deep in a squealing hog.
I printed them on regular paper cuz i didn't want to pay for nice ones. These were free.
Made with love.
Friday, February 28, 2014 9:11 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I slept with my gun under my pillow last night, I'm a cowboy.
Seth Vance
Eduardo, el caballero.
Why? Do you feel threatened at night?
Brayden Haws

Has anyone seen my piss?
Merit Egan
haha
great movie, great moment
Edward Ekstrom
Seth, Annie was scared.
So I loaded my gun and slept with it.
Merit Egan
My gun is not very accessible. Just in a closet. If someone broke in, I'd have to call a timeout, get my gun, load it, that shoot that M F'er in the face.
Brayden Haws
I don't even have a gun yet cause kasey said I couldn't have one but now I convinced her so now I gotta get one
Probably gonna get a bazooka

Edward Ekstrom

Tyson Amundsen
I'm really impressed with the outpouring of community support
Seth Vance
I'll grow a big mustache, but instead of shaving it, i'll burn it off my face.. in honor of Colby. The pain will be nothing compared to losing a dear friend.
Merit Egan
Haha, burn that shiz off, for colby!
Colby Condie
You are all my friends
Tyson Amundsen
The Google vox has become a séance, we are communicating with the dead

Also, Ike Egan himself is giving a brief devotional to me and Bryan's wards this weekend #PatriarchOfThePatriarch

The effects were cool, but it was way unrealistic. I thought we were past unrealistic space movies. Once science was invented.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Also its been a while, so here's Mr. Chang
http://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=wXw6znXPfy4
Why does it just show a url and not a little window thing #gaaaaAay
Merit Egan
Haha that is the best YouTube video ever made
Besides Tyson Amundsen for president and Extreme Tree Climbing
Merit Egan
Jack just called, he said that CTU had new intelligence that Colby Condie has faked his own death for reasons not yet known.
Brayden Haws
I bet it has sonething to do with Ukraine
Merit Egan
Colby is our new Ace of Spades. Our number 1 target.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Colby Condie
Hahaha (cover laughing). I am not the real Colby
If I told you where he was, I would have to kill you
Merit Egan
Where is he!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brayden Haws
His Italian training is a major indicator to me
But then again he's a loose cannon he could be anywhere

This is the last known picture of Colby, this should give us some insight into his character
And thought patterns
Merit Egan
Haha

Brayden Haws
Haha
If this was cranium, merit would win creative cat

If you have isis mobile wallet, barbacoa is doing $2 entrees. You have to link a card to it, which is very east.
easy*********************
Colby Condie

I am only allowed to release this pic of Colby last seen here rowing silently. Where the he** is he?
Tyson Amundsen
The susquehanna river, clearly. He's returning to deliver the priesthood, again.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Seth Vance
Hahaha nice teez.
Merit Egan
Under further inspection, teez is absolutely right
Edward Ekstrom

chattanooga TN has even better internet than google fiber because you can sign up for different tiers if you don't need 1 gb/s
Seth Vance
So i met this girl last semester who is wanting me to road trip with her to Louisiana (which is where she's from) for the entire spring break. She's cute, and if i went I would have to get with her... #noexcuses
But I don't wanna be in Louisiana for the whole break... What plans do we have so I can tell her no.
Merit Egan
You can come to Disney Land with me
Seth Vance
Thank you merit. I appreciate that.
Also, we need to do Colby's proxy work..
Tyson Amundsen
Seth, how did your last trip with a girl go?
Seth Vance
Haha it wasn't great..
Wait, which one?
Iowa?
Or an adventure trip, like havasupai?
I was young and confused when I road tripped to Iowa.. Haha If I can talk her into shortening the trip I might go.
Merit Egan
Tonight I start the school schedule of mega gay. Monday-Thursday, 5:15-9:45
Tyson, cue up Mr. Chang
Edward Ekstrom
Haha merit that is mega gay

Edward Ekstrom
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBpBCSW5uN8&feature=youtube_gdata_player
This one is better
Tyson Amundsen
That calls for the ten hour loop of Mr Chang merit
Seth, you obviously have no business going
Colby Condie
Seth that is what seriously dating couples would do. Or at least that what my long lost comrade Colby would say. He is still missing
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah Seth I'm really just flabbergasted that "a girl you met last semester" is inviting you home to meet the family.
Merit Egan
Then again, we did just have hometown dates on the Bachelor, so it makes a lot of sense
Seth Vance
Haha it'd be an adventure thats for sure. And yeah bry, we haven't even hung out that much. I must have given a good first impression.
I can't go anyway.. I'm going to Disneyland with merit.
Edward Ekstrom
I second merit. Hometown data are always hilarious. You should go.
Colby Condie
Yeah Seth just go and be super weird to her family. Fart and burp on purpose. That's what Colby would tell you to do
Seth Vance
Haha
She's really pressing for me to go..
Maybe we could get married while I'm at there too..
Merit Egan
Clearly she wants more than just a "trip"
Seth Vance
Tyson, Louisiana = LA.
Brayden Haws
Seth be careful, knowing you you'll probably have sex with her if you go
Seth Vance
Hahaha
I'm a protector of virtue.
Merit Egan
yeah, if you go, sex will definitely occur
that's a long time to be trapped in a car with all that teenage rage and hormones
Seth Vance
Haha valid points by all.
Minus the sex
And the teenager.. She's 20.
Merit Egan
shoot, I forgot we're not all high schoolers anymore
sex will not occur
Seth Vance
Well, with my past history it wasn't far off to assume she was 18 merit.. Haha
Colby Condie
Yeah any time there is any sort of trip to a place with a girl. Sex happens
Seth Vance
Haha Colby knows. He is viewing life from beyond the veil.
Merit Egan
any time a boy and a girl are remotely in the same area...sex happens
Colby Condie
Eye contact between a man and woman: sex
Merit Egan
Even if you are riding trax, and you sit in a seat that a girl had been sitting in within the last 2 hours: Sex
Colby Condie
If you touch any sort of currency that a woman touched, you just had intercourse with her
Tyson Amundsen
Haha this was really funny and is getting weird
Merit Egan
That's why i always use protection when handling any type of currency
Tyson Amundsen
You can tell because Bryans picture is going all red in the face
Merit Egan
haha
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
hopefully there isn't another girl on earth right now with her face turning red, because there's only one thing that would mean....
SEX
Brayden Haws
One time I opened a woman's mail by accident
I had sex with her
Colby Condie
See haws knows.
He's in a sex class right now
Merit Egan
That's the one place sex doesn't happen. It's immune. You could even have sex there, but it wouldn't count as sex.
Tyson Amundsen
Colby died as a result of execution. Why was he executed? Premarital, St. George-style SE
Merit Egan
It kills 30% of the people who try it. Very dangerous.
Tyson Amundsen
Seth, you should go meet your Valentine girl's padres
Merit Egan
I won a galaxy tablet from 97.5 the zone today #blessed #sportsradio
Edward Ekstrom
Really merit?
That's awesome
I want to get one and use it as my phone. I done get why they don't give you the option of using whatever you want as your phone.
Merit Egan
Haha eddy we share desires. It is true. I lucked out.
Seth Vance
What does it mean that the US is putting all military engagements on hold?
*military engagements with Russia
Colby Condie
It means that Colby Condie is single handedly kicking a** in Russia and Ukraine right now. He told me to tell you that. Here is an updated picture:

But this pic was taken yesterday in Kiev. Who knows where he is today.... 24 hours is a long time for him to go anywhere
Merit Egan
Classic AK47
Tyson Amundsen
Seth that's a strange sentence, but I bet it means if we have any training excercises with them they are postponed
Cuz Russia is a bad guy
Seth Vance
Just quoting the news headline. #notmystrangesentence
I've been staying informed a little better. Baby steps.
John Sherwood
All right dudes, I've only told a few people about it. But I've got an interview with Goldman Sachs tomorrow morning. Send a quick prayer my way.
Brayden Haws
Oh dear goodness
That's awesome
Bryan Samuelson
Roger that, you've got our prayers. You'll dominate
Seth Vance
You got it John.
Tyson Amundsen
John I know your hammer will be mighty
Also idk if you've thought about getting a priesthood blessing, but if it were me this would be an occasion that would be 100% appropriate and desireable
From Haws or roommates or home teachers
Bryan Samuelson
I wholeheartedly agree with Tyson.
John Sherwood
Ooh intriguing. I'll have the roomies give one too me
To*
Tyson Amundsen
It'll definitely help. I had one last week before my presentation. Good call
Brayden Haws
Aye they always help
And I'm always at your dispense John
John Sherwood
Thanks higgs. Just got one from justin and kelb. Good guys
Colby Condie
Power of the priesthood

Tuesday, March 4, 2014 11:27 AM
John Sherwood
All right boys... first interview(s) done. It took 2 hours! But I feel it went well. We'll see though
Edward Ekstrom
Nice!  When is the next interview?
What kind of stuff did they ask about?
Tyson Amundsen
Ayoooo John
John Sherwood
Just dissected my resume and then case studies and hypotheticals and crap
They'll let me know if there is another interview in 1-2 weeks
Brayden Haws
Oh Booyah John
That's how we have fun
Merit Egan
Just John Goldman.
Bryan Samuelson
Just Goldman Sherwood
John Sherwood
Its sachs. John sachs
I hope so at least
Tyson Amundsen
Just John Goldenwood
Bryan Samuelson
Just the Sexy Golden Sachsman
John Sherwood
Oh bsam wins it
Bryan Samuelson
Haha ayoo. John you're the real winner here
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha
Lol'ed Sman
Brayden Haws
Honestly they're the real winners when they hire John
Best worker since Joe Montaigna
Edward Ekstrom
John, you've got the golden sach.
Colby Condie
Golden scrotum
Edward Ekstrom
Drillbit Taylor: You'd be surprised, anything can be turned into a weapon of mayhem or destruction.
Emmit: Even a puppy?
Drillbit Taylor: Especially a puppy. The Germans used em' in World War I. De Hundin Schtorman, Lightning Dog. They'd attach dynamite to them, Rommel did it, jerry bastard...
Brayden Haws
"can you do it in the butt?"
-nurse at my work
Colby Condie
She's clearly having sex
Merit Egan
Clearly. No doubt about it.
zach fackrell
Hello friends!! Ayoooo
Tyson Amundsen
What the...?
zach fackrell

Merit Egan
Zach is alive. When do you get home dear child?
Tyson Amundsen
Zach don't worry. The only thing we have discussed in your absence has been sex. And John the Sexy Goldman Sachsman
In reality, too much sex. I blame modern media and pop culture
Merit Egan
Lots of sex. And Colby's death
Tyson Amundsen
And Haws class
And that everyone is married but me and Bryan
zach fackrell
Alive and well. Just way sunburned hhaha I can add some input on sex. Lots of little philippinno lady men offered me massages in the streets with happy endings. Sex was implied.
I denied.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha lady men
Merit Egan
Seth is going on a road trip with a chick, they are definitely going to do it. It's inevitable.
Brayden Haws
Haha guys I know Tyson hates when I talk about my sex class but this is too good to pass up. One of the sections of my textbook is literally: Oral sex from the 69 positions
Everyone is just doing it
Seth Vance
Tyson, I know I don't share a lot about my life.. but I'm not married either.
zach fackrell
Good on ya Seth. Just don't do anything hawsz book depicts or describes
John Sherwood
When are you coming home z?
Tyson Amundsen
Sick Haws
John Sherwood
Or will you have no time between this and the cruise?
Tyson Amundsen
Seth you are vox less active, and only recently have activated. So I'm not counting you in previous convos
Merit Egan
Church ball or school tonight? It's region game 2.
zach fackrell
I'm back Thursday afternoon at 1:30 then I leave for the cruise the next morning
Merit Egan
I'm leaning towards churchball
Tyson Amundsen
Who all is on that cruise? John you aren't right?
John Sherwood
Nope. Churchball merit
Colby Condie
Schumann and Josh right Zach?
zach fackrell
Atomic cruisers
Ya and some of schumanns friends. It's gonna be sweet
Merit Egan
Cruises are man's best friend. One day we will do a friend cruise. But next time Zach and I call you with a cruise in mind, you better all accept!
Colby Condie
Alaskan cruise. I know Bryan would be in
John Sherwood
I'll go on a cruise
Merit Egan
Tyson won't come till he's out of med school. So we won't go until 2019
zach fackrell
Haha tony knows
Rigatoni
Merit Egan
I'll take the mango cream and the strawberry bisque. 3 of each please.
Colby Condie
One time we ordered 5 cheesecakes and I was laying on the top bunk bed and when it was handed to me I dropped it on the lower bed. The red sauce went everywhere.
Zach knows
zach fackrell
Hahahaha just making a mess everywhere. Then we went and got 30 hot chocolates and about a thousand cream cones
Colby Condie
Then threw them all in the hot tub and laughed then ran away

Tyson Amundsen
Nah just transfigured for a bit
Merit Egan
I never experienced Tyson's last teez
Before he dies

Tyson Amundsen
Haha wonderful. Who will write my eulogy?
Merit Egan
Well all contribute a line.
Bryan Samuelson
I'm not a very good eugooglizer
Brayden Haws
Like that game on whose line
Merit Egan
You know what Tyson liked to say, "teez em once, shame on nobody, cause I'm the teez." Really that's how Tyson lived his life.
Colby Condie
"Oh our Teezr. He kissed 'em. He killed 'em. This time he got a taste of his own medicine. Broke his coccyx."
Wednesday, March 5, 2014 9:28 AM
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Merit Egan
unfortunate death. Broken coccyx is not the way to go
Colby Condie
That GIF portrays the unfortunate death of Teezr
Brayden Haws
For Tyson's eulogy I'd just read all the comments from the mgmt video from people who thought he was actually dead back then
Seth Vance
Fly the American flag speedo at half mast.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Haha

BNDR tomorrow anyone? I've got the itch
John Sherwood
I could definitely do that
Bryan Samuelson
Good John. Who's with us?
Merit Egan
I wish I could
Bryan Samuelson
Our nation mourns for the patriarch's school schedule
Tyson Amundsen
Indeed
Tyson Amundsen
I'm willing to BNDR. It's not the best night for me, but camaraderie is a priority
Seth Vance

Go utes!
Tyson Amundsen
Oh please, oh please
Bryan Samuelson
Seth you're a great American. Finally a road win for the Utes!
Seth Vance

Thursday, March 6, 2014 9:24 AM
Colby Condie

Tyson and Bryan.
John Sherwood
So bowling?
Tyson Amundsen
I feel it's you me and Bryan who could. all things considered I might vote for another time. Sman que dices tu
John Sherwood
Colb
He's in
Colby Condie
Yes. Colb's in
Brayden Haws
I have work and the wife has school, haws'=no fun
Bryan Samuelson
Ok we have me john Colb and Jonny Liu. Also Sarah. If Julia and Minnie are coming as well that makes 7, Tyson you'd make eight. We could also recruit Sam Casaday and others. I think we have enough to do it, so I'm in favor, but also considerate of fiscal responsibilities
John Sherwood
I'd be willing to do it. Although I don't want a way late night. I'd want to start at 8 or 830
Bryan Samuelson
That works for me. Tyson? Colb?
Colby Condie
Yeah man I would be down
Bryan Samuelson
O teezer where art thou
John Sherwood
Sman it's your call. Bowl or no? And time, if bowl
Bryan Samuelson
I say we bowl. 8:00 start?
John Sherwood
Sounds good. I'll be there? Teez and colb.. I'll see you there
Alex Crawford
I would be in for bowling but if Sarah is going I'm out. Avoid awkwardness whenever possible.
Tyson Amundsen
It's only awkward if you let it be. Plus at this stage you are just putting off the inevitable. Best to swallow the bitter pill quickly, in a good environment
John Sherwood
What the?? Why would it be awkward?
Merit Egan
Enlighten John please.
And me
Edward Ekstrom
And me.
John Sherwood
And my axe
Tyson Amundsen
Alex sorta dated her like 2 yrs ago
That's JT
It
Alex Crawford
No I didn't date her. I got rejected big time. I wanted to date her and she turned me down.
zach fackrell
Guys I'm home!!! AMERICA!! Let's bowl and party
Tyson Amundsen
I don't remember it like that.
You definitely went on at least 1 date
Alex Crawford
And this too shall pass. Unless not...Bryan what's the status. How was the date?
I think 2 dates but that's the point.
John Sherwood
Well zachs in town. And wants to bowl. If we dont bowl I'll be angry. It's Zachs wish
And zach is dating tara, crawdad. I'd be a monkeys uncle if I didn't want to bowl with him
And h
Her
We're all grownups.
Alex Crawford
Well if Zach is home then screw awkwardness.
John Sherwood
That's the ticket
Tyson Amundsen
John the trigger is already pulled. It's just about Alex now
John Sherwood
True dat
zach fackrell
Friends are friends till the end. I like bowling and I like you guys. lets do this
Brayden Haws
John you're both the hero we want and the hero we need
Bryan Samuelson
Welcome home Zeezer! I agree with your sentiments. Crawdad the date was a good time. I love my friends and I love partying with them
John Sherwood
Cordial temporary welcome to zeez. I'll see everyone tonight
zach fackrell
Thanks dudes. I'll see you later
Brayden Haws
Zach are you leaving tomo?
If so I won't see you and I'll weep
Tyson Amundsen
Haws you don't work tonight. why are you not coming?
oh crap. It's Thursday. Nevermind
Brayden Haws
Teezr man, you know my whole life, where I am at all times
I appreciate that
And your friendship
Guys I seriously hope to party thi weekend. I was sure to get this whole weekend off and all next weekend so I can party
I don't care if kasey doesn't want to, I will be there, this is my personal constitution
Tyson Amundsen
We have that in writing, Haws
Merit Egan
When is bowling?
Brayden Haws
Exactly, now I can't abandon it
Tyson Amundsen
Mary you tell us. You're the Patriarch. We will bowl when you bowl
Da* autocorrect
Also merit how about 8
John Sherwood
Skip school
Brayden Haws
Merit fug your school man
They just think they can keep you there forever
Bryan Samuelson
Do they have any idea who they're dealing with?
Tyson Amundsen
what about a jersey night? timely considering RSL starts this weekend
we are the official Real Salt Lake bowling team
Bryan Samuelson
I feel good about a jersey edition
Tyson Amundsen
Colb bring all your RSLs
Bryan its settled- jerseys
Merit Egan
I could bowl from 7 to 8, then back to school
zach fackrell
Cólb being me a jers por favor
Colby Condie
I'm stepping outside the realm of soccer jerseys
John Sherwood
Braves. That's my guess
Colby Condie
You'll only find out if you come.
zach fackrell
Sorry team bonwood or sandy lanes?
John Sherwood
Bonbon
zach fackrell
Copy that
Bryan Samuelson
Haha Sarah can't come now. So Crawdad you have no excuse
Alex Crawford
Ah man. I want to come. We are cooking dinner. I'll keep you posted.
Colby Condie
Cooking dinner? C'mon Crawdad. What are you married or something?
Alex Crawford
Precisely. I think I can make an 8:30 start. Is anyone willing to give a ride?
Colby Condie
Wait did we decide 8 or 8:30?
John Sherwood
What did we decide??
Bryan Samuelson
Let's say 8:15. Colb bring the trophy
Tyson Amundsen
Colby, we are testing your claim to end CST
And Bryan's to stop BST
John Sherwood
Two tests
Brayden Haws
According to the latest graphs BST is in the rise
Edward Ekstrom
"Bryan!"
Tyson Amundsen
How many confirmed? We are getting lanes
Edward Ekstrom
I wish I could be there
sadly...

That's a cool screen shot.  Way to go mac computer.
Now you all know exactly what I have been looking at for the past 4 hours.
zach fackrell
I'll be there in 10
Just finished food

Friday, March 7, 2014 10:30 AM
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Hahaha
Moneyball. Great flick
Colby Condie
I just endorsed the heck out of merit on LinkedIn.
Merit Egan
10 people have called wanting to hire me since colby endorsed me. He has quite the reputation in the business world
Can I hear a report of last night's time arrival situation. Was colby on time, was bryan on time?
Bryan Samuelson
Oh I was on time Mertdog
John Sherwood
Sman on time. Not so much colb
Colby Condie
I've done better in years past. But I've also done worse. It was an average show up time for me.
The young and inexperienced Colby would have showed up much later
Merit Egan

Before today
I had a great day in the market
Tyson Amundsen
I actually think colby arrived at an acceptable time. He arrived right as we were switching places
Tyson Amundsen
Only $45 for a day pass to PC tomo
John I wish we could do it but I'm occupado
Colby Condie
Do what Teez?
John Sherwood
Dang teez. I'd do that
Friday, March 7, 2014 9:28 PM
zach fackrell
Teez I'm in your homeland! LA
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/iDXH5l54CWU
Tyson Amundsen
Zach I love it, where are you staying?
ATTENTION GOOGLE VOX: Bryan and my ward just went sledding in soldier hollow followed by a short devotional from our own Ike Egan. He's doing a great job, talking about avoiding dangers and explicit content in the media. Then the shiz hits the fan
On the front row is Bryan, with a less active kid named Big Tony. B Tony likes coming to activities but really doesn't believe in the church at all. So as Ike is preaching' the word, Tony pipes up "You can't really say that. Nothing in the media is bad. 50 shades of gray is super graphic but I learned so much from it. Other things that have 80% profanity have taught me so much. We can't self censor, then we deny ourselves knowledge" and on and on
Everyone in the room is umcomfortable. I can see the tension building in BsamTown who is sitting next to Big Tony.
Really Ike handled it well, but big tony would give up so easy. He was like "we can't just look at the surface of these things, there is so much substance" blah blah blah
And Ike closes up shop real nicely. So then Bryan has a 50 minute car ride with tony home....
Tune in to the real vox to hear the results. This is why I hate not vocal voxing
Bryan Samuelson
Dudes that was an experience. Tyson is right, this is where the vocal vox is absolutely necessary. The whole car ride home was deep philosophical and religious discussion. It took me six
Minutes of vocal voxing to try to describe it.
Tyson Amundsen
Six minutes, a new record! #PREACHIN'
Great job Bryan, Great job Ike, good job big tony
Merit Egan
Bryan texted me the vox and it worked. Good story bsam. I shall ask father Ike about it tomorrow. #mypatriarch
Saturday, March 8, 2014 9:01 AM
John Sherwood
Wild story. Ike could've baffled him with a zillion riddles
What's everyone doing today? I believe I'll go golf a little late. Everyone is welcome. Or if people want to ski, I'd do that at 3 too.. also, tonight is RSL. I think we should watch. And play games. 3-1 we play wits and wagers
Tyson Amundsen
I do Hobe interviews 12-4, otherwise it'd be a great ski day. John I can party tonight. Kick is at 830 I believe #believe
Bryan Samuelson
I'm working a 9-5. Then watching the Duke game at 7. There's a decent chance I'm in for rsl and games post duke game
Colby Condie

Bryan Samuelson
Thugz Mansion haws
Alex Crawford

I woke up to the worlds longest leg hair sprouting from my calf.
Edward Ekstrom
No way that's a leg hair! ! !
Colby Condie
Was it physically plucked from your leg? Or just resting
Alex Crawford
Physically plucked man. It was attached but I couldn't get a good picture of it so I had to pluck it.
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan text me the vox.
Colby Condie

Colb let's do yours. Anyone interested in caesers beforehand? Or eat separate but equal
Colby Condie
My house is a go. Unless we do johns and play four square after.
I'm fine either way
Tyson Amundsen
Four square? Make the call John
John Sherwood
Colbs. We're having family dinner soon. We won't be there on time
Tyson Amundsen
Colb what time can we gather
Colby Condie
X:

I have been invited and asked to help in giving a blessing to Lauren's grandpa tonight. We could do my house but it would be tough because I need to leave my house at about when the game starts. You all are welcome to come over anyway we just won't be here. The easier route is doing someone else's house and we could be there for the end of the game and post game fun time
Seth Vance
My family is watching a movie.. Tyson's house. Or we could party at Colby's and eat all their food while he's gone.
Tyson Amundsen
Ok my house. Kick at 830. Come now Haws, you have a log journey
Seth Vance

Why does this say 8pm?
Also, Ned is wearing a different uni than everybody else..
Tyson Amundsen
It's not at 8
Maund with the start? Interesting. Schuler and Watson Siriboe are still out, so we went with Maund over Salcedo. Good move
Colby Condie
Not gonna lie.. Salcedo is good but he's a punk. At least when I talked to him.
Tyson Amundsen
He's young. Hopefully it gets squashed out of him. I'm sure it came at the stretch that he started a bunch when we had injuries, he played well
Brayden Haws
Ned a bad Ah, he probably didn't like the new jerseys so he refused to wear it
Colby Condie
I think my doubt of the new jerseys has turned into dislike
But I still love RSL
Brayden Haws
I just hate the gold stripe
Like it just looks all splotchy
Colby Condie
Agreed
Seth Vance
I agree haws. Who designed that crappy stripe?
Colby Condie
I need to be the marketing manager at RSL. I would make kick a** jerseys
John Sherwood
Tyson I'm coming over
Brayden Haws
We're in route, pardon the delay
Sunday, March 9, 2014 12:24 AM
Seth Vance
Pardoned.
Tyson Amundsen
Who can forgive sins but God alone, Seth #findingfaith
Seth Vance
Haws, I forgive you man.
Brayden Haws
Seth thank you, there is nothing more comforting than your kindness
Sunday, March 9, 2014 9:25 AM
Merit Egan
Good morning campers!
Edward Ekstrom
Greatest gif yet
Did real win?
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah they did, 1-0 @ Galaxy. Heroic by rimando, was huge all night and saved a PK in the 93rd minute
Dude you shoulda come ed. But you always spite us by coming to Sandy and then keeping your own company
Brayden Haws
Rimando probably diffuses bombs as a hobby
That's how calm he is in the clutch
Tyson I think we missed wwe
I think it was last night
Tyson Amundsen
Haws shiz man, who did we know that went to that? And great parallel with Rimando. In all honesty, we're witnessing a sort of golden generation of Utah sports with RSL.
Rimando, Kyle, Javi are stockton and Malone level
Edward Ekstrom
Annie parents were in town so we going out with them.
Edward Ekstrom
Look it up, bookworm.
Brayden Haws
Tyson; I found out cause luke went and he went hard, he posted on fb a pic of himself dressed like a redneck, and his fiancé went so I like her now
Honestly I don't think I would like soccer as much as I do if not for RSL, the same being true for many people, they've brought the sport into our lives and for that we must thank them, and great be god for giving us Javi
Tyson Amundsen
Well said Haws
Brayden Haws
And I say these things....amen
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha exactly
Edward Ekstrom
Amen
Haws is the best man alive. In my name, amen.
John, did you golf yesterday?
Colby Condie
Yes John and I golfed Old Mill yesterday. Weather twas a beaut
John Sherwood
Yes we golfed. Played like crap. Weather was grand. Actually after I played with colb, I was frustrated with my performance, so I went to bonneville and played 9 more
47 front. 41 "back"
Edward Ekstrom
Haha nice. Alright team, Annie and I are planning my graduation trip. Where would be reasonably priced but awesome and different than the us?
Colby Condie
"us" meaning for short usual? Or do you want to travel outside the US?
Edward Ekstrom
Outside the US
Colby Condie
Zach is the most experienced traveler of all of us. He no have wi-fi on the cruise though
But I would recommend either Ukraine, Egypt, or Iraq.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
I always recommend a cruise.
Always
Caribbean
John Sherwood
I'd say central America or if you could somehow get a cheap flight to Thailand... one you get there... it's the cheapest place on earth. Huge dinners for $7 bucks. That's for both of you. And massages
Tyson Amundsen
With happy endings
Merit Egan
Haha. Wholesome teez with the unwholesome tease
Edward Ekstrom
Cool unwholesome teez
Colby Condie
Or Iceland eddy.
Or New Zealand. Go walk where Gandalf said "Mellohn" to the gates of Mines of Moria
Sunday, March 9, 2014 8:55 PM
Colby Condie

John Sherwood
Best gift
Gif
Brayden Haws
Gif and gift
Both
Thank you Colby
Merit Egan
Haha what a gem
Monday, March 10, 2014 10:06 AM
Merit Egan
She has been real good to me boys. Tyson don't get mad.
Tyson Amundsen
I'm glad for your success merit
Edward Ekstrom
I like to hear that Tyson. Wholesome
Tyson Amundsen
After Bryan Seth and I lost our last 7 games of FIFA last night, I realized I needed to make some changes in my life. I'm a new man now
Edward Ekstrom
Wholesomeness reinstated.
Tyson Amundsen
The problem I now have is what do I do with the garments I rented in my anguish #sackcloth #ashes
Edward Ekstrom
Shmear the ashes on your face like an indian in testament of your sorrows.
Brayden Haws
Guys clee and tgrant just text me wanting to know if anyone would wanna play ball later today
Bryan Samuelson
Gosh dangit I always want to play but I never can. Fiscals are the worst
What time would y'all be playing Higgs?
John Sherwood
Ooh I could play at 530. Until 8
I have things at 8
Bryan Samuelson
John's 8 o'clock is ironclad.
Brayden Haws
Uh idk, Craig just text me cause he got a new phone and had no ones numbers but they're pretty flexible. I'm also thinking perhaps we just try and play Wednesday or something when we can better plan it
Colby Condie
To Haws and Eddy: Shelby the red head just walked into the Zions branch I'm working at
Edward Ekstrom
You mean rhonda?
Colby Condie
Yes
Red head Rhonda
Monday, March 10, 2014 7:21 PM
Colby Condie
BSam you at the jazz game tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
Anyone wanna volleyball with me Seth and co?
Tyson Amundsen
John did you just favorite a tweet from Jan '13?
John Sherwood
I did. I was showing Julia how cool Twitter is. Found this tweet. Chuckled

Tyson Amundsen
Haha I also chuckled. And tried to favorite it, but I already had
Keep showing her the good tweets #teezin'em
#circletweets
Tyson Amundsen
IT'S GOING VIRAL
Colby Condie
#joinusjulia
Bryan Samuelson
Colb I was indeed. Fun fact, I was featured in a gram from the jazz's official account


Now look closer, behind the dude in the hat
Tyson Amundsen
I hope the sides of your hair are WAY short #zachperry
Colby Condie
Hot dang Bryan. Those are way good seats
Sarah took you? She knows her priorities
Bryan Samuelson
I know man. Kudos to Sarah. By far the best seats I've ever had
Colby Condie
Stick around her Bryan. Mark my words
Tuesday, March 11, 2014 11:37 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, is Kelly pregnant?
Tyson Amundsen
Smart money is this is a smokescreen from Eddy. Clearly, he/Annie will be pregnant first
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan your uncle just got released
You probably already knew that though.
Brayden Haws
That is a great trick by eddy
Edward Ekstrom
We're not pregnant
but kelly keeps instagramming baby surprise
and stuff
She could be just tricking all of us though.
Merit Egan
Haha no she is not.
Brayden Haws
Provoc
Tyson Amundsen
...... or is she?
Merit Egan
Negetory. There is no pregnancy. We want to be DINKs (double income no kids) forever
Brayden Haws
That's my plan too, and I'll buy guns and give them names for my kids
Colby Condie
And haws will also buy a goat like he had planned right?
Brayden Haws
Yeah man, Ernest Hemingway, first thing I'm buying when we get a house
John Sherwood
How was the date bsam??
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, who is posting those instagram then!
Someone must have hacked kelli's account
John Sherwood
Which pictures are you looking at ed? I can't see anything out of the ordinary
Edward Ekstrom
Merit's #babyalert and kelli's #ihaveahugesurprise
Bryan Samuelson
I also didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I'll look again
Brayden Haws
I don't have Instagram but this sounds real controversial
Edward Ekstrom
What!
Am I taking crazy pills?
Colby Condie
I think merit was referring to Kelli when he hashtagged #babealert
John Sherwood
Let's play feef tonight.
Bsam teez and everyone
When do you leave bsam?
Bryan Samuelson
Yes John. I'm in. Leave tomorrow at the butt crack of dawn
Tyson Amundsen
Que hora?
Bryan Samuelson
A que hora fifamos o que hora do I leave?
Colby Condie
Haha fifamos
Tyson Amundsen
Cuando fífamos
Bryan Samuelson
I'm free from about 8:30 on
Tyson Amundsen
Colby, I'm sending you something I need you to put in here
Colby Condie

courtesy of Matt Copenhaver via Teezer
Brayden Haws
Crawdad, this will explain all you need to know about copenhaver
Brayden Haws
Have you guys heard of the A11FL? Lets all try out for it
I want to go pro
Colby Condie
Dang I just read about that a bit. Sounds pretty cool
Brayden Haws
Yeah dood lets for our own team. The Salt Lake Stormin Mormons
We'll sign John to be our star receiver and copenhaver can play center
Colby Condie
Haha
Have you guys seen the Zach Galifinakis interview with President Obama?
John Sherwood
What is a11fl? And no I haven't seen that colb. Pretty funny I'd guess
Brayden Haws
It's a new pro spring league that's starting that uses original offensive rules, no jersey number restrictions, so anyone can be an eligible receiver depending on where they live up
Line-up
So one play you could be the center John and the next a wideout
John Sherwood
That's what I'm talking about
Bare bones. Finally. Like the football we grew up on
Brayden Haws
Yeah so realistically depending on how you use your lineman you could have like two extra tight ends on a play
If your left tackle just pancakes a linebacker and is all alone you can just dump the ball off to him
Colby Condie
http://www.viralforest.com/barack-obama-appears-between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis/
Lets round up a team haws
Also, here's the link to that funny interview john. And all else who like laughing
Brayden Haws
There's still two teams up for grabs, maybe we can convince them sandy needs one.
We really would need copenhaver though, on that last stretch of the mile run when he'd get sprinting, no way anyone could tackle him
John Sherwood
What time is feef bsam?
Tyson Amundsen
Seth and have already planned to party with some guorls and ppl from our ward for a bday party. Probably making smores
John Sherwood
Hmm I thought the team was the most important
Bryan Samuelson
Oh no. I'm available after 8:30
Brayden Haws
I work til ten but if you are still playing/wanna go hard I'm in
Tyson Amundsen
I doubt that Haws. John you are right, but the schedule had no game on it tonight
Brayden Haws
Dood fu Teezr
Fu Quentin
Tyson Amundsen
Haha but I'm not wrong
Brayden Haws
First voxer didn't work and then you said you were only gonna play for an hour not 4 so I had no incentive to drive that far
John Sherwood
I'm on injured reserve starting tomorrow. I want to play like it's the last game I'll play
Brayden Haws
Where are you going for rehab John?
John Sherwood
The only place sane enough to take me. Vegas
Tyson Amundsen
That's only one example of many, and I was only an hour off in my estimation
Bryan Samuelson
Bangarang John! What time are you leaving/how long are you staying?
Brayden Haws
Guys I'm coming with you, I'm off the rest of the week and kasey works all week, I'm happy to ride in the trunk
John Sherwood
Ya haws come with us. So tomorrow we're leaving in no hurry. We're hoping utah wins and we would go to the Thursday game. Knock on cedar. The luckiest of woods. But ju and I are going to Celine Dion tomorrow. If that doesn't make you excited. I don't know what would
Brayden Haws
Just on Brayden's computer taking a test with this hangout popping up and I for one am excited for you and if you dont feel up to the task of the great performance that will be presented by the great Celine Dion, I am happy to go in your place. That is all.
-the Mrs.
Bryan Samuelson
Gooooood John. I will do my very best to help the Utes tomorrow
Brayden Haws
Hey I told you to stay off my hangout
Merit Egan
Haws, women cannot google vox. Next they will ask to drive and play basketball
Brayden Haws
Exactly man, those are my sentiments exactly
My computer was hacked
Alex Platis
Someone should explain to Whitley that she doesn't need to marry a homo just because gay marriage is legal now
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha
Wednesday, March 12, 2014 10:58 AM

Seth's hometown
Seth Vance
That's right John... "Come for a day, stay for a lifetime"
Home of amazing annual festivities, such as: The Scottish festival... Payson Onion days..
...and that's pretty much it. Ha
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
You guys have spring break this week?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BYU is the worst..
I told Annie if I weren't graduating in August I would transfer back to the U.
She got mad at me.\
Bryan Samuelson
Good Ed. Your heart is in the right place
Tyson Amundsen
I agree with Bryan- you are a man of principle Edwin
Edward Ekstrom
John, the mathematician, is half way between merit and Colby
Colby Condie
Within a matter of days I will be in the same spot as John and merit will take my place in salt lake
We are world travelers
Edward Ekstrom
Just tuned in.
Tyson Amundsen
Colb where are you and what are you doing?
Preston Idaho?
Colby Condie
I'm closing up a million dollar drug deal in downtown Preston
Tyson Amundsen
As only binski could
Crawdad, why you no answer my call today? Skiing was glorious! And I saw something I've never seen before
A helicopter went and flew some ppl up to the top of the peak that is right above Road to Provo/ Powder Paradise! It was way sick, I've never seen them land there
Colby Condie
Who wants to fill out a bracket and do a March Madness tourney?
I would put some money in to the pot to make it more interesting
Edward Ekstrom
I would put 1$ in
Because I'm pretty sure my bracket will suck
Colby Condie
I would put $100
Edward Ekstrom
I'm ate cafe Rio last night now I'm poohing a loaf as big as the burrito.
Seth Vance
I would participate, because we're friends.. But I wouldn't put any money.
Maybe a dollar.
Colby Condie
Guys the church encourages gambling. If we all put in $10 the winner could rake in $100. Easy money. Get rich quick
Seth Vance
Ha I just know I won't win.. I know it... With every fiber of my being.. I bear solemn witness.
Colby Condie
Whether you think you'll win or lose, you're right Seth

Thursday, March 13, 2014 1:28 PM
Brayden Haws
When is Jeff coming home?
I have a spicy setup for him?
Crawdad, congrats on the anniversary
Bryan Samuelson
Ooh spicy setup, you know how I feel about those. Jeff will take her on the best theme date she's ever seen
Colby Condie
Jeff has been sending me spicy pictures of him and this chick who served in my mission who's there in Jerusalem with him
Tyson Amundsen
All spicy dates must come through my approval, because we know spicy redheads belong to me
Also Crawdad great pic. I'm glad it was good to you guys. My wife will ski and make good cookies and salsa like Megan. Or else.
Seth Vance
Happy anniversary Alex G.

Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
Why don't you just move there Colby
Bsam and John when are you coming back from the tourney?
Colby Condie

Would anyone Spring Breakers or non working people like to go to the temple tomorrow morning? I'm planning on going
Edward Ekstrom

If identity theft is fixed, I will rejoin the old vox. But also keep new vox.
Edward Ekstrom
It is not, there is much identity theft still in the old box
Vox

Haha that cannot be his birth name!
Colby Condie

John Sherwood
I googled it and that name is a comedians name. He must've loved him so he switched his name. Or his parents loved the comedian
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha that is the funniest name imaginable. John you are a specter from the gods
Good investigatory journalism
John Sherwood
Last year we filled out brackets on espn. Fill them out again and join funky jazz. You just fill it out and then region the group. Not difficult
Merit Egan
Password?
John Sherwood
I think if you fill out the bracket first you can join without a password. It let me at least
Merit Egan
Failed. I have a bracket but still need a password
John Sherwood
Crap
Merit Egan
I bet you can change the password
Or send an invite that bypasses it
John Sherwood
Password is ostertag
Didn't change it. That's what it was
Merit Egan
Haha success
I shoulda known
Colby Condie
When in doubt, use ostertag

John I need to learn at your feet. This guy with the funniest voice I've ever heard just came into my store. It was like a combination of
James earl jones and rafiki. I was struggling to keep it together
John Sherwood

Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie
We will never know until Mrs Haws shows physical evidence of a growing womb
Brayden Haws
Don't be looking at my wife's womb Colby
Colby Condie
I look at all womens wombs
Tyson Amundsen
I propose a womboscopy to know with a surety
Colby Condie
All in favor: I
Tyson Amundsen
Who here has seen The Cider House Rules? #zeezrom
Brayden Haws

Merit Egan
I don't know what to believe anymore. I'll do a recon mission to Kelli, as she would have heard from Kasey.
Kelli hasn't heard anything. HAWSSSSSS!
Tyson Amundsen
Merit don't go to alternative sources. That always leads to misery
Colby Condie
I say there's no way she's pregnant
He needs to buy a goat first. Ernest Hemingway

You tell me right now!
Brayden Haws
All I can say is someone sent me that pic
That someone being my wife
Merit Egan
The picture looks too perfect, it had to come from the internet. Nobody has hands that stable, not even surgeons
Seth Vance
Have you seen that pregnancy filter on Instagram? It's real.
Everyone is using it these days
Merit Egan
Seth has convinced me. I shall throw a baby shower for #babyhaws immediately
Edward Ekstrom
Seriously Haws?
Brayden Haws
You tell me
Merit Egan
I have received intel from Kelli, who has received intel from Kasey that Haws is lying!
I knew that picture was toooooooo perfect
Brayden Haws
unless she doesnt want anyone to know until we tell our parents later so she is hiding it
but i dont lie to my friends so i told
Colby Condie
Congratulations haws.
I'm gonna post it all over Facebook Twitter and Instagram now
Brayden Haws
i endorse colbys actions
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha Haws you little trickster, just tell us1
!
Merit Egan
Retweeted and favorited
Colby Condie
Goooooooot
Spread the word
Kasey haws is pregnant
Seth Vance
Kasey haws is having twin boys! Great news haws family.
Tyson Amundsen
Here's some more great news!

Alex Crawford
Whoah! Just tuned in. Congrats Haws on the little one. If this is a fraud you should be ashamed. But we know it is not.
And happy day to John! Haws this has got to be some sort of scheme to steal glory from Johns day of birth by implying a birth of your own.
Tyson Amundsen
A lot of people hate genetically modified foods
Brayden Haws
crawdad what kind of sick narcissist would i have to be to try and steal john's glory?
Alex Crawford
That's the question I pose to you Haws? That is good evidence for the truth of your pregnancy.
I'm all for GMO's Teezer. Without them we'd never enjoy things like seedless watermelons, twinkles and BBQ beans from chickens.
John Sherwood
A cordial thank you to all. And haws! You kidding me? That's crazy.. assuming it's real. I think it's real
Brayden Haws
John I cannot tell a lie to someone on their birthday.
John Sherwood
All I wanted for my birthday was to be a godfather. Best news
Brayden Haws
John did you watch my video? That's better than being godfather
John Sherwood
I didn't. I'm at work. Text it to me so I don't have to go through the archives
Brayden Haws
I just sent it, happy birthday my man
Merit Egan
John, this is my present to you. I think you have to open it on a computer, but who knows
http://john.sherwood.you.are.my.friend.aninote.com/
John Sherwood
Thank you gentleman. If my math is right... baby haws will be born on March 19 2015!
John Sherwood
I want to play feef soon. My wish is we can get 7 players. Rainbow attack
Merit Egan
Anything to make that birthday wish come true. Saturday?
John Sherwood
That's probably the most ideal time for me. GNO. Anyone is invited. Even gals. Although ju can't make it
Feef on one screen, tourney on the other
Brayden Haws
Shiz I have work but I'd come later if it's late
Merit Egan
Oh sweet mercy
Haws, Now is the time to prepare.
get work off
John Sherwood
It's early enough
Hey off work at 5
Brayden Haws
John as I was saying earlier, I cannot lie to someone on their birthday
The end of that statement was that baby haws is fake
Me and Teezr made it up
Colby Condie
I don't believe the cover up.
Kasey is pregnant!!
Merit Egan
Tweet it colb!
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know what to believe anymore
Merit Egan
Haws I'm sorry I used my wife to pry out the real answer
that was an unfair advantage to destroy the joke
Brayden Haws
Haha it's okay the truth needed to come forth
For the sake of johns birthday
John Sherwood
Haws you've betrayed me. I thought in a year I'd be a godfather.
Tyson Amundsen
Friends at first are friends at last
John Sherwood
Now if you don't come to feef, I won't know what to do
Brayden Haws
John I love you and you're a great man, but I'm not sure that with you current math showings you are prepared to be godfather
Thus we must delay the baby for a few more John BDays
Edward Ekstrom
good call Haws.  Lets have babies at the same time.
You too merit.
ETA - 1 year from now.
Tyson Amundsen
I'm in.
Bryan Samuelson

Tyson Amundsen
I like craft
John Sherwood
There goes my billion
Merit Egan
mine too
only 19% of the brackets are still perfect, after the first game...
haha
ESPN brackets
Colby Condie
I bet Warren Buffet got so much money from endorsements of the additional millions of people making brackets.
I read this morning that the chances of getting a perfect bracket were 1 in 9.2 quintillion

Thursday, March 20, 2014 3:53 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Rough game for the Cougs..

Friday, March 21, 2014 9:04 AM
Alex Crawford
So after the first 16 games my father-in-law still has a perfect bracket...
Tyson Amundsen
Wow
Merit Egan
I heard that Warren Buffet will offer to buy people out if they still have a perfect bracket going into the final 4. $100,000,000 right then, or you can take your chances for a billion.
Edward Ekstrom
I bet someone well hack espn and Chang theirs to perfect.
Merit Egan
I was thinking that. For a billion dollars i bet people will try like crazy
Edward Ekstrom
Yup. So yesterday had to be some sort of record for overtime games
Brayden Haws
I read this article about warren buffet that he's only giving 90000 to each of the kids when he dies and giving the rest to schools and charities. And bill gates said he's gonna do something similar cause yet want their families to earn what they have just like they did
Merit Egan
I would hate to be one of their kids
I'd be like, "Hey Dad, let me just have some?"
Brayden Haws
Haha and it said one of warrens sons asked him for a loan and he made him apply like you would at a bank and he denied him the loan
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Sicka
Sucka*
Merit Egan
Sorry son, you just have bad credit
Brayden Haws
I'll find the link it was funny. Amazons owner told his wife that he wouldn't spend money for a maid or nanny cause they were capable of cleaning the house theirselves
Merit Egan
Warren Buffet should give his kids all a decent sum of money that allows them to take a risk at starting a cool business or something. Otherwise they will just work for the man and probably never make it big.
Brayden Haws
I assume by now most of them are pretty well off, he's pretty old so they gotta be too
Merit Egan
Yeah i guess they are old enough by now
Edward Ekstrom
Pavlov is sitting at a pub enjoying a pint, the phone rings and he jumps up shouting "oh sh**, I forgot to feed the dogs!"
Brayden Haws
haha eddy
great work
great joke
Edward Ekstrom

These are pretty good.
John you'll love them.
John Sherwood
The writing is too small. Send it in an sms text to me
Merit Egan
John do you have the Note 3 yet? You can read anything on that screen
John Sherwood
Not yet. Tonight or tomorrow
Edward Ekstrom
John, I just shared it with you.
I don't know if it will be bigger this time.
John Sherwood
Shared it via what?
Edward Ekstrom
gmail I think?
wait google plus
can you check your google+?
John Sherwood
Oh ya I got it. Let me indulge
Edward Ekstrom
The logicians and the bar one is good.
do all of you want a drink?  I don't know, I don't know, yes.
Merit Egan
Bsam...WTF
Edward Ekstrom
Uh oh Bryan
My condolences.
Merit Egan
My condolences as well. Also, my bracket is dead.
I had them losing in the championship game
Colby Condie
Oh gosh mine too
Bryan Samuelson
I will now go into the wilderness. Probably to die
Colby Condie
What is happening this year
Bryan Samuelson
I hate to say it, but I saw this coming. The way we played this year was a recipe for disaster. Can't get stops. Don't attack the rim. No semblance of interior scoring. Chuck up threes. So depressing
#prayforBryan
Edward Ekstrom
I support #prayForBryan
Colby Condie
That has to be the last game to destroy all perfect brackets
John Sherwood
#prayforbryan
I had them sweet 16 luckily
Alex Crawford
And...Mike's (Megan's dad) bracket predicted it. 17/17
Unbelievable.
Colby Condie
Crawford you must be joking now
Alex Crawford

He had Stanford losing so now he is minus one pick.
Edward Ekstrom
There went a billion dollars..
Tyson Amundsen
I'm in great position to win $50 at work in the bracket. 6 out of 9 ppl in the pot had them going to the elite 8, and two had them in the final four
Colby Condie
I'm in 685th place out of 1987 people in my pool
Tyson Amundsen
How about this: I'm not very stoked about the expression "eat your cake and have it too"
Colby Condie
If I get in the top 20, I will earn anywhere from $1000-$17000
Tyson Amundsen
That's great colb. What do you think about my question
Alex Crawford
That expression is a little weird. There must be some deeper meaning where the phrase originated.
Bryan Samuelson
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can't_have_your_cake_and_eat_it
I like expressions and idioms and such
John Sherwood
I had never even heard that idiom. Nicklemania tonight boyz?
Tyson Amundsen
I also like them, but not that one. Makes no sense.
Colby Condie
Tyson I think you have it wrong. It's "have your cake and eat it too"
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think reversing the order changes it
Bryan Samuelson
Read the Wikipedia thing man. It makes more sense to me now
Tyson Amundsen
The Wikipedia article is good
The idea being you can't wish for two incompatible things
Possessing the cake and eating it are mutually exclusive
Example: you can't root for an upset you didn't pick in your bracket and be satisfied, cuz whatever outcome happens you will lose something
Colby Condie
I always thought of it like such as (miss America girl) :

Someone gives you a cake as a nice gesture. If you decide to eat it all for yourself, it's a bit selfish. So the term means that when you are given something then you should share
More or less
Tyson Amundsen
Gay cake. So john, nickel mania?
John Sherwood
Ya man. I want to at least. Roll call? 2
Colby Condie
Minni and I: 4
John Sherwood
Rare high school sightings: collete maxwell. Alli york
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen

Also Shane Liu just asked me what we're doing tonight
John Sherwood
Get him to the mania! I saw collette golfing of all places. Saw alli at work today
zach fackrell
What time is mania!?
John Sherwood

Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
I'm in for mania
I get off work at 830. Haws or john can I come over til we go
John Sherwood

Merit Egan

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Nah man, im just gonna stay at work til about 9 then I will go
Brayden Haws
Okay sweet. Obviusly I ate dinner and then fell back asleep but now I'm ready to go
Tyson Amundsen
You are sleeping a ton recently. Just baby Haws. Old man Haws

dude I was on the phone I want to be in a video call
Edward Ekstrom
Whoever guesses which awesome childhood movie classics Annie and I watched tonight get a billion dollars
Alex Platis
The great mouse detective
Edward Ekstrom
Matilda and Heavyweights
Alex Platis
G-D it. Heavyweights was my first thought. I'll settle out of court for $500,000,000 plus lawyer's fees.
Tyson Amundsen
Great mouse detecive is awesome
Much like these bad boys
#getlucky

#snakeeyes
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
If you start right at nine I'll play one on my commute to work
zach fackrell
50%
Colby Condie
100%
Merit Egan
100%
Tyson committed 100% on the original vox.
That's 3 at 100% john?
John Sherwood
I'll be there . My only concern is the girls want to go to park cafe at 10
Tyson Amundsen
As a Jew, I'm not concerned about it #Al #homage
And maybe this is a dumb question, but why don't they just go to park cafe then? They've run there before. You pick them up at 11.
John Sherwood
True true.. I just don't want to be the one to tell them that
Tyson Amundsen
Merit doesn't seem concerned. Or colby
Colby Condie
Is anyone going to hectors
Tyson Amundsen
It's not like they don't know already. Merit tell your wife.
Merit Egan
There's a betos on Highland and 4500. Cheaper and more filling than Hectors. Hectors keeps shrinking.
John Sherwood
Or someone drive to park cafe.. get picked up for the run. No pick up service needed
Colby Condie
Minni is coming to my house in the morning then we're driving to your neck of the woods john and merit. They're gonna run while we Feef I think
Merit Egan
Good good. OK everyone, let's be prompt. All parties on PST. That's patriarch standard time and is rarely used. It is always right in time.
Tyson Amundsen
John you mean like leave a car for them there? Where is this place
So I can take care of myself. Lauren will take care of colby. John what concerns do we need to resolve for the park cafe
This is coming together nicely
Merit Egan
The girls have it under control. They are meeting at Park cafe and driving in 1 car up the canyon.
John Sherwood
Swizz
Problem solved. #extragames
Merit Egan
I have 4 controllers. 1 for me, 1 for teez, 1 for john, one for colb.
Tyson Amundsen
1 for early Haws in case of CST
John Sherwood
²
Tyson Amundsen
Or colb get one from bryans house on the way
Lights out in ten minutes
Merit Egan
See you for pregame stretches at 8:50
John Sherwood
Let's get bsam.
Tyson Amundsen
He's on the vox. He's out.
Colby Condie
Stretching involves soda, candy, and thumb stretches
Bryan has fiscals
Tyson Amundsen
I'll swing by 4500 south and highland for pregame orange slices (wink)
There you are Bryan
Colby Condie
And this is a feefster beefster. If you shower before, then you're not allowed to play
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah sorry guys, fiscals prevent me from coming. But the desire of my heart is to be there
Tyson Amundsen
You guys still shower?
Colby Condie
I haven't showered.... In YEARS (Pres Monson Reese's Cup voice)
Tyson Amundsen

zach fackrell
What te heck are you reading Tyson? #newyorktimes
Merit Egan
Haha colb. Good sentence
Tyson Amundsen
Joe Smith, Prophet seer and revelator
#pooparty
Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
All in favor of voting Colby out of the vox?
Brayden Haws
I agree
I quit the google vox because of this
Brayden Haws left the conversation
Colby Condie
Guys it's my elbow

Tyson Amundsen left the conversation
Brayden Haws and Tyson Amundsen joined the conversation
Colby Condie
Don't you dare
Merit Egan

Merit Egan
Great goal bsam
Edward Ekstrom
Hey everyone, were planning ax 4th of July trip to Annie's cabin. Heber has a huge firework show. Annie's inviting her single friends too so you single people should come too!
Brayden Haws
Just saw online that there is one perfect bracket left, 33/33
Edward Ekstrom
What say ye?
Bryan Samuelson
Haha thank you for that Merit, I'm just happy to contribute. Also that sounds sweet Ed
Saturday, March 22, 2014 5:54 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Cool just nobody is excited
John Sherwood
Ha ed I'd be so jazzed to go. Alas for the 4th, ju and I and the Sherwoods are traveling to tropical north Dakota and Minnesota
There is actually a chance we don't go, in which case, I'm in. Ju too (I'm guessing)
Brayden Haws
We're all excited eddy, too excited to type
Colby Condie
Edweina that sounds amazing. Lauren and I are gonna look into our scheduling to see if we can come
Brayden Haws
Yeah the scheduling is the real bi here cause we're already going to Disneyland and a cruise this summer
Colby Condie
Dayton is crazy
zach fackrell
Ed I like the sound of that. I might be going to California that weekend so I'll check and will let you know when I know just so you know
Merit Egan
Heber AZ? That would be so sweet. We'll have to look into our schedules
Colby Condie
How long will you be there eddy
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah Heber az. The cabin where our wedding was.
Heber is the town you guys stayed in
Where the hotel was.
Zach, who might you be going to California with?
zach fackrell
The family. Michaels fam has a house at lake arrow head.
We'd either go the 4th weekend or the 24th
Sunday, March 23, 2014 10:09 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Geez I thought this was advanced notice enough that none of you would have plans!
Colb, I'm not sure how long we will be there.
Merit Egan
Can the senator provide a jet?
Colby Condie
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy I'm in, but no ruckus can be caused. Turns out two of the largest injuries of my life have occured on the 4th of July weekend (tomato cage ankle 2006 & cliff jumping ankle 2013)
Unless Annie's single friends are willing to kiss it better if I get hurt. Also if I don't get hurt

Brayden Haws
We're also in, pending kaseys work not being faggy
Jeff just looks like some kinda molester
Tyson Amundsen
Um no haws? he looks great
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson I'll make at least three of Annie's friends swear they'll kiss you if you get injured
zach fackrell
*when you get injured
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Jeff Knudsen
Hey, lay off my stache and beautiful pose in that pic
Brayden Haws
Jeff I was just kidding man, you look great
Jeff Knudsen

When are you coming home?
Jeff Knudsen
April 24th my friends.  What news is there from the mother land
Brayden Haws
Jeff I have a spicy set up for you, that's the news
Colby Condie
Jeff did you hook up with Anna Thurston
In Jerusalem
Tyson Amundsen
Haws yes you can.
And I'm not injury prone. They are proportional to my things

The Sunday school teacher just played Wavin Flag by Knaan. Also a motivational talk from a sports show. This is why ppl bail on the second two hours of church
Brayden Haws
Haha what is wrong with that ward? It used to be good
Seth Vance
I leave, and the ward just falls apart..
Jeff Knudsen

At soccer the upper classmen used to call Shane Liu "Wang". It was hilarious
I blame society's woes on Haws and his class
Bryan Samuelson
Some sort of diabolical plan to cause uncontrollable laughter in the workplace
Edward Ekstrom
Haha

Brayden Haws
Jars of barf
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws

Edward Ekstrom
I remember that.
I don't remember her eating popcorn..
Tyson Amundsen
your friend that does it. She comes home and her friend is like I haven't eaten anything but popcorn for a month
and by your friend I mean her friend. In the movie
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it.
You guys paid close attention in that movie.
Brayden Haws
It was scarring
You can't get that stuff out of your head

I love this, old vox and new vox living in perfect harmony.
Merit, how's work? I just checked locations.
Merit Egan
work is good. I'm glad you are utilizing it to see where I am. Now if you would only let me stalk your location.
Edward Ekstrom
I shared!
With you
And colb and John

The 2 others are colb and john
In other news, Hughes (DC area) just offered me a job
Colby Condie
Hot dang eddy. You gonna take it?
Edward Ekstrom
As of right now though it's more likely that we'll stay at Xactware and move to salt lake on August
In
Colby and John, do I show up in your locations?
You the all show up in mind
Mine
John Sherwood
No you don't..
Edward Ekstrom
Wtf
Colby Condie
It took me a bit to get it figured out on mine
Edward Ekstrom
Colb, merit still can't see you though.
Merit Egan
Edward is visible!
Yeah, Colby you show up on John's but not mine
Colby Condie
What?!
Merit Egan
double check and maybe stop sharing with me and reshare
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, did I just show up?
Or did you refresh or something?
Colby Condie
Merit can you see me now
Look how close john merit and I are right now
Working men
Edward Ekstrom
Tantalizingly close.
Merit Egan
Indeed
You just showed up
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooo.  colby what did you do to make it work?
Colby Condie
Just reset my location sharing settings
Edward Ekstrom
I accepted some google products thing.
Maybe that did the trick.
Merit Egan
This is wonderful!
John Sherwood
What we do
Colby Condie
Look at us.
All grown up
Merit Egan
Just got my 2$ burrito from barbacoa using isis and now my free Jamba.
Edward Ekstrom
Is it just one?
every?
Merit Egan
An 11$ value for 2$
You can get as much barbacoa as you want, then 1 jamba per day
Edward Ekstrom
1 free jamba per day?
and as many $2 barbacoa as you want?
No way.
Merit Egan
Correct
John Sherwood
Correct
Merit Egan
I've had barbacoa everyday this week.
3 for 3
Edward Ekstrom
How can that be?
Merit Egan

John Sherwood
$10 off toys r us too
Edward Ekstrom
Wait, so how long does that last?
and is it good at all Barbacoa and all Jamba Juici
?
Merit Egan
All of them
John Sherwood
April 30 for jamba
Merit Egan
The barbacoa thing might end on the 31st of March. They might extend it though.
Plus you get 25 bucks when you sign up, which turns into 12 free barbacoa if they are each 2$
Edward Ekstrom
Just downloaded it.
Colby Condie
Holy shiz
Isis?
Edward Ekstrom
Too bad iPhones don't have NFC
#Samsung4LYFE
Merit Egan
so to get 25 free bucks you have to sign up for express serve. It's just a loadable prepaid card. There are no fees or anything if you have it in your isis wallet. Or you can just link a wells fargo card and get all the deals

Edward Ekstrom
Ayoooo

Haha, she will obey
Tyson Amundsen
In a biology discussion section. The TA looks like she jumped in a pool and then came straight to class, she's dripping wet. I have no idea how, its not raining that hard
Also she could be pretty but isn't. It's like she doesn't even try
#boredinbiology
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Merit Egan

Friday night GNO feefganza
Tyson Amundsen
Haha merit diversify yourself
I learned it from fantasy stocks
#zing
Merit Egan
I put half my money into 1 stock and it skyrocketed. Now i'm in first place. #nodiversity
Tyson Amundsen
A short sighted policy that will yield short term results
Colby Condie
Joao is considerably shorter than me. 5'4" probably. I don't know his exact height on the roster but he's short
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan should set him up with that one latina he brought to the game last year
Colby Condie
Hahahahaha
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
She was like a baby
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah man. In a month or two we should all go to a game again
That was a good time
Colby Condie
I would
John Sherwood
I will
Edward Ekstrom
I am
Tyson Amundsen
That's settled
Thursday, March 27, 2014 6:08 PM
Seth Vance
Cool colby. Did he deposit? withdraw..? set up a mortgage? Joao is he doing?
If I ever meet Mr. Plata I'm gonna have ask him: "Joao you doing?"
Thursday, March 27, 2014 9:13 PM
zach fackrell
Hey dudes!!

Who wants to come to NOAH at 10:10 at century?

Ok awesome, I'll see you there
Edward Ekstrom

Wait, how do you have 10:10 tickets?

Tyson Amundsen
Al

Oak river current
Edward Ekstrom
Who's coming to Brett Dennen tomorrow night?
Brayden Haws
I want to. I hope we can. We have a family party tomo though
Edward Ekstrom
Boooooooh!
Merit Egan
Before we start talking about tomorrow, let's talk about tonight. Plans?
Brayden Haws
Dead Sea scrolls, then feef?
Merit Egan
Feef scrolls feef
Edward Ekstrom
I'm in
The Noah
Then*
Colby, how do you get the 50 free dollars?
On the serve card?
I want Barbacoa
Merit Egan
I just signed up on the serve card from Isis and it added it to my card automatically
Edward Ekstrom
Immediately?
Merit Egan
yeah within a few minutes
Edward Ekstrom
Oh good, I'll be patient
Merit Egan
have you already set it up?
Edward Ekstrom
There it is!
Yup
It just added
Merit Egan
ah to the yeah. The funny thing is when you use Isis on any purchase over a dollar, you get a dollar back. So barbacoa turns into a 1$ purchase.
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooo, how do I find other deals?
Merit Egan
click the + in the upper right corner, then click browse offers and all offers
Edward Ekstrom
So when I scan it its just free jamba?
Merit Egan
yep, just tell them you have isis, order a small, an then scan it
Edward Ekstrom
Like that'll say 5 dollars but it's free
Awesome
Friday, March 28, 2014 12:28 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Free smoothie in my hand, ayoooo android rocks
It's only 1 a day?
Merit Egan
That's the rumor. I've never tried it twice. I believe John has.
Edward Ekstrom
John, did it work?
Annie and I just get free everything.
Google gives us free internet, Isis free food.
Now we just have to find a place to live for free.
In provo, so we don't lose google fiber.
Merit Egan
I will pose to you this conversation i overheard moments ago, simply to ensure that my friends are not all retarded.
walking out of 7-11, girl 1 "I can't believe this was only a dollar"
girl 2 "We literally got this for free!"
Colby Condie
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
1 dollar is litterally 0 dollars.
literally*
Merit Egan
fact
Colby Condie
1 = 0
Merit Egan
1 dollar=free, and free=0 dollars, then 1 dollar=0 dollars
I believe that is the transitive property
Edward Ekstrom
Alright, here
's a proof that is trippy
I bet no one can figure it out.
John, you don't count.
a = b
a * a =  a * b
a^2 = b^2
wait cancel that one
a^2 = ab*
there we go
a^2 = ab
a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2
(a - b) (a + b) = b ( a - b )
 ( (a - b) (a + b) ) / (a - b)  = b ( a - b ) / (a - b)
a+b =  b
Merit Egan
a-b=0
Edward Ekstrom
no wait
Colby Condie
Eddy you lost me when you started using letters
Edward Ekstrom
at the beginning we stated that a = b
so now b + b = b
2b = b
divide by b
2 = 1
What is wrong with this proof?
john don't answer
here it is all one after the other
John Sherwood
Teez, crawdad and I just got done skiing. No way I'm find math now.
Merit Egan
b+b=2b
Colby Condie
b + b doesn't equal b
Yes merit has it
I think
Edward Ekstrom
but the proof just showed it does
Colby Condie
The second part isn't equal
Edward Ekstrom
because we were at a + b = b
and at the beginning we saw that a = b
so b + b = b
Colby Condie
a + b = 2b
Edward Ekstrom
no a + b = b because of this step
 ( (a - b) (a + b) ) / (a - b)  = b ( a - b ) / (a - b)
we divided out a - b
and that left us with a + b = b
Merit Egan
that equation =0
(0)(a+b)/(0)=b(0)/(0)
Edward Ekstrom
you found the problem
dividing by 0
good job merit.
Merit Egan
YES!
I taught you everything you know about math
up through high school
Edward Ekstrom
For your great work, you get a free jamba
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom
That is true
You took me under your patriarchal wing and weaned me to math greatness
Merit Egan
Remember how you did just as good as jeff on the final. Jeff, give us a shout out from the Holy Land
Edward Ekstrom
Yup, my brain was just made for math, Jeff's was made for adding up money.
Colby Condie
Zachs brain was made for making kick a** videos
Edward Ekstrom
and making those money charts every month
what are they called again
Colby Condie
Tyson's for caring for lambs and soccer
Edward Ekstrom
income statements
Merit Egan
John's brain was made for slowing down every sporting and game event in real time so then he just has the fastest reflexes
Edward Ekstrom
balance sheets
cash flow statements
Jeff knows.
Merit Egan
FIFO
Edward Ekstrom
First in first out.
Merit Egan
LIFO
Edward Ekstrom
last in first out
Merit Egan
a^2+b^2=c^2
Edward Ekstrom
FILO
Colby Condie
Merits brain was made for inventing Borg
Edward Ekstrom
John is going to be our in to the stock market
Colby Condie
FIFO = FIFA
FIFA = FUN
Edward Ekstrom
He'll get me wired in and I'll hack the system and steal bad rich people's money
Merit Egan
FUN=FRIDAY
FRIDAY=TODAY
TODAY=FIFA
Edward Ekstrom
and i'll dispurse it to you guys over isis
Colby Condie
TODAY=FREE
Edward Ekstrom

Nothing brings a girl into the fold like watching us manly men dismantle opposing defenses, send rockets into the side netting, and initiate classic RSL action and unselfish play.
Edward Ekstrom

John let's play at your house. We can play feef for an hour or 2 (or 3), and then play 4 square and stuff
John Sherwood
We can do that
Edward Ekstrom
Colby do you have a cousin named Josh Condie?
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
How much is dead sea scrolls?
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom

John Sherwood
Sayid from lost
Edward Ekstrom

John Sherwood

Edward Ekstrom
The Bucks must be trying to lose.
John Sherwood
6 per day. No joke
Edward Ekstrom
What!
I want 6/day
It's okay, I shouldn't complain.  I get everything for free basically.
Tyson, how can we get in for free to the Dead Sea Scrolls?
Merit Egan
I want google fiber to come to SLC. Rumor has it that SLC is on their list of cities bidding for it
Edward Ekstrom
Really?  That would be awesome!
Merit Egan
https://fiber.google.com/newcities/
Edward Ekstrom
I bet they do Nashville next.
You better hope it's salt lake.

free internet.
Merit Egan
bsam, what say you of feef?
Tyson Amundsen
Merit you know Bryan doesn't Google vox.
Merit Egan
tyson, you are being like sydney rigdon
undermining the feef and the patriarch
Tyson Amundsen
Patriarchs are men too, not infallible
Merit Egan
you're right. How dare I use my calling in that manner
Tyson Amundsen
Read this article merit. And colby, its about sports and over hyping young athletes
http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/03/28/throw-freddy-futbol-even-mls-must-be-wary-johnny-manziel-effect
idk why its only posting a URL, but follow it
in a soccer context
Bryan Samuelson
Merit I feel good about feef. Sarah said she's probably doing something with her friends tonight, in which case I'm in. Although I think we should incorporate some tournament viewing in as well
Tyson Amundsen
I love being wrong, especially in my analysis of bsamtown. Welcome #reddanger
Bryan Samuelson
Haha
Colby Condie
I dont know Josh Condie. Maybe he's related to me somehow
Friday, March 28, 2014 8:55 PM
Merit Egan

John Sherwood

Baseball games too right?
Merit Egan

John Sherwood
Just me.
Bryan Samuelson
Oh I just looked. And saw. And now I'm coming
John Sherwood

Post lunch feef
Tyson Amundsen
I responded to Haws, I wipe my hands of this
I love eddy and eddy's bday, but I have work unfortunately
Bryan Samuelson
I also have work, which is the worst
Brayden Haws
I'm home and can go
Tyson Amundsen
Haha Haws
Edward Ekstrom
Merit can
John Sherwood
I'm at work. But want to go
I'll feef at 330 though
Edward Ekstrom
La frontera at 1
Not the bbq place
Has and merit?
Brayden Haws
I can go, my wife is gone therefore she can't
Edward Ekstrom
That's okay
Bryan Samuelson
Ed I wish I could be there to give a warm birthday brace
Embrace*
And bracelet
Colby Condie
Ed I thought it might not happen anymore so we planned a lunch at 1 with Minni's fam. I want to be there
Merit Egan
Edward! I am helping Dane move. I was under the impression it had been postponed. Dinner?
Edward Ekstrom
Hey all, this is Annie. Let's raincheck this for another time. We are eating with ed's cousins tonight. Haws, is that alright?
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's just fine but lets for sure do it soon. Me have to celebrate the eternal eddy reaching manhood
Tyson Amundsen
Merit and colby thought it wasn't happening. Why? Haws' sexuality class messing things up again
Colby Condie
Yeah I really want to go to eddys bday lunch so we should set a time soon when we can all indulge in eddys bday glory
Hahahahaha Tyson
Tyson Amundsen
Meanwhile, if anyone wants to come hang out with me and feed my sheep (name: Iris) I am flying solo from 4-630
Looking at you Haws
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, go read Noah and tell us the historical synopsis...the real historical synopsis.
Tyson Amundsen
I read it like a month ago. Basically we already heard it right. What you said is right about prophets in general. What Haws said is mostly true, tho the use of the funny word 'wine bibber' is limited to the BoM I believe.
John Sherwood
Matt siegel sighting. Anyone remember him. I only recognized him. Never would've remembered his name. Just helped him to the land of zion
*in the land of zion(s bank)
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, wine bibber reference pleases
Brayden Haws
Genesis 9:19-21
Talks about him being drunk and also his son seeing him naked
Which some scholars say was bad because it was actually an endowment ceremony that he walked on in
Tyson Amundsen
And by some scholars you mean me
Cuz we discussed this after I read it. Like his sons jacked his garments
Which they were obviously not authorized to have
Brayden Haws
You and many more
There's a lot other texts that describe it in more detail
This highlighting the importance of documents like the scrolls
Merit Egan
How does our organization feel about a real feef fake feef party tonight?
John Sherwood
I'd play at 330 or 4. But I'm going to the game with bsam. And I know teez is too
Merit Egan
I see
zach fackrell
I feel like I wanna come to the game
Or watch it with my friends
Merit Egan
How'd you get tickets, and is it possible to get some by you? We might be interested. Might.
Bryan Samuelson
We did the maverik thing for tickets. Section 6 row w. Potentially still available
Tyson Amundsen
Zach are you even here?
zach fackrell

I'm leaving bear lake
Logan
Bryan Samuelson

Brayden Haws
Merit I just woke up from my nap
Merit Egan
We're feefing at johns. So close to you
Brayden Haws
Johns apart?
Merit Egan
On foothill. Get. Here. Now.
Brayden Haws
Sadly we have to go to dinner at my parents but I'd play later
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
Feefing now. Some are going to rsl.

SABO
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
I would feef
No doubt in my mind
Merit Egan
Good call

Tyson Amundsen
Everyone should be aware that RSL just put on a masterful performance. Silky smooth passing. Magical game from Javi. I am a very happy man
Brayden Haws
Watched it, loved it. We're at the next match, I state my regret I wasn't there today
Tyson Amundsen
It really was cool.
I hereby ask Bryan to communicate to the Google vox whether Sarah had fun, etc. Crucial info
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah man, I felt like she had a good time. I had a good time
Merit Egan
Tell em about the kiss!
Bryan Samuelson

Follow me for sporadic tweeting. @sizzlin_seth
Colby Condie
Good morning everyone
Seth Vance

Good after noon colb.
Colby Condie
Seth if I just wake up it's still the morning
Seth Vance
I can understand that.
But I had been awake for a bit.. It was afternoon for me...
Is it lawful to reply to a "good morning" by saying good afternoon?
Merit Egan
I'm out of the bottom 15% in espn brackets! #16.7%
Colby Condie
That calls for a celebration. Sunday FEEF
Merit Egan
Oh how lovely was the fifa, radiant flowed the goals all day
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Colby Condie
Haha
Praise to the FIFA, who brought us together. Blessed and anointed that game'll ever be
zach fackrell
Surprise friend sighting:

Edward Ekstrom! Just at the home ward today. Booya let's all play risk and eat treats tonight
Colby Condie
Tyson there's a good lookin red head in my singles ward. She's single. Take her out
Tyson Amundsen
Colby YES
Take a discreet photo
And have her fill out my application
Edward Ekstrom
Zeezler, great idea. Who is nigh?
John Sherwood
I'll be nigh
Tonigh
Bryan Samuelson
Call me Bill Nighy
That's how nigh I am
zach fackrell
I'm nigh
Edward Ekstrom
Annie just got called into work.. We have to go back to provost..
Colby Condie
Son of a
Where is game night? And what time?
Colby Condie
Roll call for game night. Me and probably Lauren (depending on the time): 1.5
Edward Ekstrom
If you come have game night in provo I'm in.
Anytime the rest of the night.
Merit Egan
I will not be in. Too many fiscals
Edward Ekstrom
Merit is excused.
You're all excused if you don't want to drive to provo.  But it would be fun
Edward Ekstrom
What do you guys think of the foul called against nick johnson of Arizona?
Bryan Samuelson
Bad call
Edward Ekstrom
Because of the situation or because it wasn't an offensive foul?
Bryan Samuelson
I really don't think it was an offensive foul. I wish there were more no calls in that situation, it seems like every drive is a foul one way or another these days
Edward Ekstrom
True
Merit Egan
I took this picture yesterday. These people disgust me.

Edward Ekstrom
Haha worst.
Colby Condie
Haha clear bandwagon jumpers
Edward Ekstrom
They subscribe to a catalog that sends you the most recent professional sports champions.
's decal.
Merit Egan
Haha seriously. No real person would be a fan of the seahawks and the heat. It makes about as much sense as bathing in a pool of fecal matter.
Edward Ekstrom
I bet the driver of that car has kids that go to Alta.
Merit Egan
Haha
No doubt
Tyson Amundsen
I concur
Seth Vance
That's just gross.

Edward Ekstrom
Seth has been reactivated in all social things today.
Seth Vance
Something else that's gross
zach fackrell

Brayden Haws
I bet we could get into a fight with those kids
Seth Vance
Yessir eddy.
Tyson Amundsen
Seth?
Brayden Haws
Couldn't beat em but we could fight em
Seth Vance

Edward Ekstrom
Patriarch, initiate the call
Merit Egan
#ineverseeyouanymore
Seth Vance

This is what happens for me when I try to join a call...
Crashing. I think I probably just need better wifi.. Or a new phone. Eddy?
zach fackrell
great call
Edward Ekstrom
good call
I showed off my new invisible codes
Merit Egan
Fantastic call. For those who missed it, eddy is invisible now
Colby Condie
Terrific call
zach fackrell

Colby Condie
I moved in. I sleep in the theatre room
Merit Egan
Uncle DJ is in the bishopric, and zach's hair continues to morph
zach fackrell
in black and white #1920's
Edward Ekstrom
Colby and Zach, where are your girlfriends?
Tyson Amundsen
Clearly I'm most upset about missing the evolution of Zach's hair. It's one of the most compelling stories in all of the 'X'
zach fackrell
On 'x' related news I went up little cottonwood last night and painted a huge " 'X' " on the cement ruins of that old mill thingy by the road. Ayooooooooooo xcerpt
Also teez I'll show you my hair soon. You're always been on my side.
Also eddy. I should probably call you about your last question. Story time
Tyson Amundsen
Also zeez thanks man. Pauz that's sounds good. I hope you just punch danced your rage out
Monday, March 31, 2014 10:18 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Yes you should Zeezler.
John Sherwood
All right boys, Thursday is the day of the proposal. I'm going up bells to ask her. This'll be around sunset. After that we'll be headed to my parents house. Everyone is invited. Celebratory ales will be provided
I'd say 8 to meet
Bryan Samuelson
Oh beautiful day of peace and rest
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah!!!
Seth Vance
Nice man.
By "." I meant "!!!"
Wish I could be there to celebrate with you
Edward Ekstrom
Free lunch smoothie
Thx 2 isis
Merit Egan
That looks good. I think I'll join you
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom
Merit, lets see your free smoothie and lunch.
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
 So loney, mr lonely, I have nobody to call my own..
Merit Egan
shizzle, I already ate my lunch and through the wrappings away
Edward Ekstrom
Great..
Merit Egan
Jamba to be consumed later
Edward Ekstrom
How do you get $1 back?
In purchases?

Merit Egan
It just does it automatically like 3 days later. It has to be over 1$ and payed with your phone
Brayden Haws

Edward Ekstrom
Okay cool
Colby Condie
Haha great GIF haws. I've seen it before and I laugh every time
Also great pic Teezr. #condor
Brayden Haws
Merit we just saw you mother
God bless her
Also the new voxer update is Bitchin
Merit Egan
glad she is spreading the Egan cheer.
I would also like to update my vox to see what all the fuss is about
Edward Ekstrom
It's only an iPhone update.
Haws I just downloaded it on my iPhone, what is new?
Brayden Haws
the interface is totally new
Edward Ekstrom
Oh
Brayden Haws
it now shows you who has heard your message
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it.
Brayden Haws
which is great cause bryan always listens but never replies
Edward Ekstrom
Why haven't they released it on Android yet those jerks.
Brayden Haws
so now we can nail him on it
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah all of them said bryan has listened.
Tyson Amundsen
That's cuz he knows that we know that he knows
Edward Ekstrom
So Tyson, I understand you have a new slampiece?
or at least a possible pot?
Where did you meet her?
Tyson Amundsen
But it will force a change in Bryan's behavior. In traversing to your statement
Edward Ekstrom
in traversing to your statement?
Tyson Amundsen
*regards* I had a pot. We'll call her "the poledancer" cuz that's what we called her. Anyways, I think the poledancer's days are numbered
I met her thru gledhill
Edward Ekstrom
How did she gain that nickname?
Colby Condie
Cause Tyson and Gledhill met her at a strip club. She was pole dancing at the time they had eye contact for the first time
Merit Egan
The 2 times I've met the poledancer, I thought she adapted well to our environment. But if teez says her days are numbered, I can stand by him
Edward Ekstrom
Is that the one your brought to nicklecade?
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah ed. Merit I think you are right, she is good socially. But idk if there is much spark. I also don't know that we have much commonality
I also appreciate your input #ecclesiasticalfriendleader
Merit Egan
that is why I stand by you. I recognize that she may be talented socially, as poledancers usually are, but there is more that must make up a relationship.
Colby Condie
Who would be interested in an FHE (friend home evening) tonight? Spike ball, volleyball, maybe scatter ball. 7:30?
Brayden Haws
It's possible. Might. Maybe
I'd also go for candy land, chutes and ladders
Tyson Amundsen
I like Haws idea. But no puedo come
Colby Condie
Butt scratcher
Merit Egan
I could be available. I might have class but it appears is canceled
zach fackrell
Scatterball
Yes
John Sherwood
I played chutes and ladders and parchisi yesterday with the fam. So now I want to play scatt and spike ball with my friend
Colby Condie
Roll call. Lauren and I: 2
For scatts and spike ball
Colby Condie
Games or not?
Bryan Samuelson
I wouldn't be able to make it, unfortunately. I have to go to my FHE then study
Merit Egan
Volleyball, yes
We'd be in... 4
Merit Egan
Fine, I retract my attendance.
Edward Ekstrom
Look what you guys made him do!
zach fackrell
Nooooooooooo
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan you cannot be studying. Physics is a week away
Colby Condie
I previously stated my commitment. I am in if we get the numbers. But with each waning minute it becomes less likely
Merit Egan
Indeed, I think at this point I fully declare my intent to not attend.
zach fackrell
Alrighty then.
Colby Condie
I am with merit. If no one wants to then I say to he** with it
zach fackrell
I enjoy movies. I'd watch one of those.
I will watch one
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom

Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie

Brayden Haws
Bryan was right
Tuesday, April 1, 2014 5:20 PM
Merit Egan
Edward this new isis deal could benefit you out there in provo.
Also, it had been 17 hours since the last Google vox. #unacceptable
Tyson Amundsen

Do they just think I'm in Haws sexuality class?
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit I blame the 17 hour absence on Google box on Haws' sexuality class
Merit Egan
Clearly that is the issue. Haws, you are ruining the world with that class
John Sherwood
Just saw a hit and run my boys. I15. Stop and go. Jetta in front of me slams his breaks and runs into the car ahead. Jetta tricked me and put on his emergency lights but then zipped right out of there. I called the cops. Filled out a report. Unfortunately I only got the first 3 characters of the license plate. Apparently someone else called the whole thing in too. That guy is getting the death sentence
Doing my best zach impersonation

Good morning campers. I choose Adonyl Foyle Ekstrom
The name by which baby ekstrom shall be known throughout his life and upon the records of the vox is Excerpt Vin Diesel Ekstrom
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
So Annie told her family she's waiting until 12 weeks to make it public, pretend like you guys don't know.
Colby Condie
My lips are sealed
Merit Egan
Also sealed
Tyson Amundsen
I tweeted it
Edward Ekstrom
Really?
Tyson Amundsen
Oh wait t its secret? No I didn't
Edward Ekstrom
Goooooooooooood.
Tyson Amundsen
Time for a Google doodle poll: how many of us showered today? How many of us showered every day for the last week?
Seth Vance
I shower every day
Sometimes it's not til afternoon though
John Sherwood
I showered today. But no way I shower everyday
Tyson Amundsen
I didn't shower today.
Seth you are always rolling around in the dirt for your major, so its good for you to shower often. But the rest of us...
Edward Ekstrom
I showered today, but not every day.
Merit Egan
I did not shower today. But I will tomorrow. That 10 extra minutes of sleep was just too important.
Tyson Amundsen
Merit exactly. Eddy good job
Edward Ekstrom
I only shower when I need to do good work that day.
I feel like I focus better after  a shower.
Brayden Haws

This is what physics has done to is
Us
Merit sometimes I don't shower for like 4 days it's fine
I perform better that way
Seth Vance
Haha correct teezer. med students probably wash their a lot.. no need to shower.
hands*
Med students wash their _____ a lot? Ha Fill in the blank.
Edward Ekstrom
Why is your computer upside down?
Tyson Amundsen
Looking for answers online. Found a pdf that wouldn't let me rotate them
Colby Condie
I showered today. But my shower directly depends on how tired I am in the morning
zach fackrell
I shower everyday to help wake me up. Usually it's around 10 or 11. Today it's 1:40
Merit Egan
Colby is 100% correct. I'll shower if I'm not tired, won't shower if tired.
Tyson Amundsen
My tiredness level don't matter, its about how late I'm running
Merit Egan
My tiredness level also correlates to how late I'm running
Alex Platis
Teezer looks like a homosexual lumberjack in that picture.
Tyson Amundsen
So they all correlate.
Haha welcome back Al. Why don't you contribute to the conversation at hand instead of hate crimes against the vox?
Colby Condie
Quiz: what is another name for a double eagle in golf? John and eddy don't answer if you know
Bryan Samuelson

Merit Egan
John, I am putting in a formal request to hear about your interview today
Bryan Samuelson
I second Merit's petition
John Sherwood
It went well boys.. at first I was with 4 other candidates and we viewed a presentation and had a Q &A with a veteran employee. That was 90 minutes. So unnecessary. It was dumb. Then interview for an hour. Then I took an assessment test. I think it went well though. We'll see. Fingers crossed
Edward Ekstrom
Yeayerrrrr, good job Joao
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
YES
Merit Egan
Good work John, your interview prowess is admirable
Tyson Amundsen
Zach man, read that
Out loud, here in the vox
Merit Egan
New discussion topic: average pot time
phones have dramatically increased the worldwide average
Alex Platis
I like at least 10 mins. Gives me time to catch up on the vox.
Edward Ekstrom
What do you're mean merit?
Merit Egan
When venturing to the toilet, how long is your sitting timeframe
Edward Ekstrom
Oh, like 15 on average probably.
Also, I'm a hybrid sit stranger

Edward Ekstrom
And use disposable wet wipes to finish off
My but hasn't itched in years.
Butt
Colby Condie
I've been known to go as long as 45 minutes before.
Edward Ekstrom
45 minutes is definite leg falling asleep territory

Mine aren't until the week of the 21st
Edward Ekstrom
Because I go to gay BYU.

This is the only good thing about Provo

zach fackrell
Holy shiz

Edward Ekstrom
Yup, if I were a terrible person I would download every movie known to man all day.

Download the internet

Zach, just saw your video on the Google commercial
zach fackrell
Really??? They just paid me last week finally haha
Where'd you see it? I wanna see how much they used from my vid.
Tyson Amundsen
For the benefit of the vox, please post it here
Edward Ekstrom
It was before the previews of captain America
Edward Ekstrom
It was daytime and it was a shot from behind some people sitting by the smoke stacks.
Daytime but the sun was starting to set
Merit, you're at your Provo cabin?

Welcome back from your cabin merit
Colby Condie
Final four time
Colby Condie
Priesthood plans?
Merit Egan
Going with father Ike and my brothers
Colby Condie
anyone interested in watching RSL/Wisconsin-Kentucky game after?
*games
zach fackrell
Dudes being at conference is awesome. I sat on the balcony level and saw the seers and revelators seeing and revelating
Colby Condie
yeah man i tried to get tickets for sunday morning session.
its a tough ticket
Brayden Haws
Best way to get tix to conf: go to the conf center and stand with a sign that says "from out of town need tix" you get like and infinity
Colby Condie
hahaha
Brayden Haws
The first conference I was home my comp from Canada came and we got into all five sessions doing that and got like 12 tix to each session that we just gave to people we knew and others that needed em
Colby Condie
lets do it tomorrow
Merit Egan
I'm deleting hangouts, it's trivial #Internet
Colby Condie
I'm throwing my laptop out the window
in other news, I am recording the RSL game. We should all watch it at my house after priesthood
Colby Condie
Jabari Parker just got a shoutout from the prophet
Merit Egan

haha true

Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Erstwhile, where was Robert W. Cantwell this morning?
Brayden Haws
Tyson I had that exact thought
Like who was that guy? I don't trust him
Colby Condie
Haha Cantwell
Tyson Amundsen
I'm sure it must mean that guy Jergesen is now the managing director. Did you also notice that his letter had slight updates to it? Mormon auditing inrigue
Cantwell is always one of my favorite parts
Brayden Haws
Yeah I did, I could t decide if the letter was different or if it just sounded different cause it wasn't the usual voice
Tyson Amundsen
Yep, for sure different. My parents couldn't tell but I could
Furthermore, that was a fantastic session
Brayden Haws
I don't even know if the church is true anymore after that change
Colby Condie
Agreed.
Brayden Haws
Elder oaks man, that's what everyone needed to hear
Colby Condie
Exactly. He threw down the spiritual hammer
Tyson Amundsen
Also Ridd was great about technology. Owning a smart phone doesn't make you smart
Brayden Haws
Tyson you were right all along keeping that chocolate phone
Colby Condie
Hahaha
John Sherwood
Rip van winkle reference
Tyson Amundsen
Wonderful
Brayden Haws
God bless technology, I was way bummed I had to go to work tonight, but I got to watch the whole session
Guys game I just thought to play in a church gym: rolling chair football
Tyson Amundsen
Colby, I will watch RSL. I would like to watch it at your house also. 9 pm kick?
Colby Condie
Mormons are the best. Great idea haws. Tyson we're watching the Kentucky game. Maybe we can start RSL after this game ends. It's the second half right now
Tyson Amundsen
Ok condor. I predict the moment I walk in Brian will say "The score was ...." and watch my reaction
But update me on that games status and I will come.
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
16 minutes left in second half
Edward Ekstrom
Pianos are percussion instruments.
As we all know.
Tyson Amundsen
Colby what's the status
Bryan, colbys?
Zach?
Bryan Samuelson
How much time is left Colb?
zach fackrell
Let's do this
Tyson Amundsen
I'm on
The way
A ride zeez?
Or bsam? Speak now
zach fackrell
I'll drive
Colbsters
Colby Condie
Minor set back. We're at the 14 minute mark now. But it's recorded so we can blow through commercials
Tyson Amundsen
So are you swinging by me or are we meet there
Bryan Samuelson
I would appreciate a ride if it's still on the table
Tyson Amundsen
Zeezrom?
Bryan Samuelson
That's a great spot Colb. Enough time to appreciate the game but short enough to allow rsl viewing
Colby Condie
Exactly Bryan
zach fackrell
I can get everybody
EVERYBODY
But it'd prob be easier for teez to drive
Tyson Amundsen
Get ready
zach fackrell
I just got in my car
Meet at Colbs?
Tyson Amundsen
Aye. You get Bryan, I'll grab esteban
zach fackrell
Deal
Bsam I'm there in 5
Bryan Samuelson
Thank you zeezer

Colby Condie
Hahaha yes merit
Sunday, April 6, 2014 12:01 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Conference is as good as ever. But who else is noticing like all the sessions have ended early?
Colby Condie
Yes Tyson I have noticed that as well at least five minutes each time
But what a great session we are Mormon we are awesome
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah. I liked Elder Bednar a lot. Pres. Monson was also good
Brayden Haws
I feel like their talks are a lot shorter this conference
Tyson Amundsen
I'm looking for good studded from Elder Christoffersen
stuff
Brayden Haws
He's probably my favorite speaker
Merit Egan
He's typically a very doctrinal and intellectual speaker. Very interesting.
Brayden Haws
Highly educated and always clear,
I respect that
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly right. For those same reasons my top three usually include him, Elder Scott, and Elder oaks
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Merit Egan
Haha
Just Todd and Cortnee both have parents in the motab
Brayden Haws
I'm pretty sure I also saw Jacque schmidts dad in there too
Legit question are elder packets glasses hooked to his nose?
We haven't seen that yet
Merit Egan
Haws we saw that as well. We concluded that it was oxygen that they hid very well along his glasses. Not sure if that's true
Colby Condie

Merit Egan
Kyle Van Noy is marrying that girl from Utah who bombed that answer in the beauty pageant
Tyson Amundsen
Who? Remind me
The Iraq?
Merit Egan
No, it was like a year ago. She got on Jimmy Kimmel and stuff afterwards.

Sunday, April 6, 2014 7:37 PM
John Sherwood
Any game nights going on tonight?
Bryan Samuelson
I would play games
zach fackrell
I'm having family time for a bit. If we play I'd wanna play
Monday, April 7, 2014 1:50 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Taco bell has waffle tacos?? I just drove past one. This needs further investigation
Merit Egan
They introduced breakfast. Haven't tried it, not sure I want to.
Tyson Amundsen
The idea of a waffle taco appeals to me. Whether they can execute it is another thing
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/k7o6AVGgM4g
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, that means you'd have diarrhea all day instead of just at night.
Monday, April 7, 2014 6:06 PM
John Sherwood
Games and national championship ?
Merit Egan
I'd ultimately like to, I'm not sure about school yet
Brayden Haws
i'd also like too, currently im in class and may need to study physics
Colby Condie
Yes. My house is open
Tyson Amundsen
Haws we know studying won't really help
Brayden Haws
tyson youre totally right
might=no to me
may=no
perhaps=no
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Brayden Haws
therefore im not gonna study
Tyson Amundsen
Having said that, it yields a certain amount of mental satisfaction, which is why Bryan does it so much
Brayden Haws
bryan is the king of studying and king of doing good
but is there correlation, i cant say
there might be
there may be
John Sherwood
I'm coming over to your house colb. Let's watch on tape delay a little bit. I'll buy pizzazz
Colby Condie
Watch party? Tipoff in 30 min
Sounds good john. Actually my mom is making dinner. Not enough for a ton of people though. So maybe bring some pizza in case
I'm off at 7.
Tyson Amundsen
Haws, may = not
Colb I need no dinner
Brayden Haws
ill still be at class til like 8
So I may come
Possibly I'll come
John Sherwood
Me and ju well eat with the fam
Ha jk. Ya we'll pizzazz
Colby Condie
John I'll call Lynn (mother Condie) after I get off and let you know if there's enough chicken wings for you and Ju
John Sherwood
Not enough for ju. She loves those things. But ya I'd love some wings
Bryan Samuelson
Guys my phone was dead all day but now I'm back on line. Unfortunately I can't come though
Edward Ekstrom
I pooped 6 times today, am I pregnant?
Oh sorry guys.. meant to type that into Google
Brayden Haws
http://www.ijreview.com/2014/04/127417-california-teacher-suspended-taking-suspected-drug-dealer-viral-vid-gets-student-support/
Tyson Amundsen
I support that. Also Santa Monica High, I know that. Not told far from Al
Too far
Haws man, I like that you post interesting things. I wish you converted more if those stories into GIFs tho, which are quicker and funnier
Zach man why you no come to Colbys
Brayden Haws
Tyson I like the feedback from now on I will forward my stories to merit so he can convert them
Tyson Amundsen
Or colby, he has time
zach fackrell
Dudes I wanted to come but I was downtown doing some editing.
I should just edit gifs for this chat. That'll pay the bills
Tyson Amundsen
Haha we'll pay you for that. We'll put you on the Xcerpt payroll immediately
zach fackrell
Haha ayoo
Merit Egan
Speaking of payroll, we need to have our semi annual auditing report at our banquet this friday. Thank you.
Tyson Amundsen
Free agent Robert W Cantwell has to be top on our list of targets. I'm not sure if he is restricted or unrestricted, but there's no one in the auditing business I trust more

Colby, online tithing works.
Tyson Amundsen
Going on a twitter rampage about the proposed changes to the fight song
Quite frankly Bryan, I'll be shocked if you do nothing about this
John Sherwood
The U?
Brayden Haws
I'll join you Tyson
Tyson Amundsen
Yep. Wanna change "Utah man" cuz its sexist. Also "our coeds are the fairest" is discriminatory. You know, against all the ugly girls at our school who aren't good looking
John Sherwood
What should "utah man" be?
Tyson Amundsen
Who knows.
"Utah women and men and everything in between". Don't categorize ppl into just men or women these days
John Sherwood
That's right.
Merit Egan
Haha, this seems like such a BYU thing to do.
John Sherwood
Oh switch byu cougars because a cougar is a mom seeking relations with young guys. Oh switch uvu wolverines because you van switch some letters and make the word "wenis" from WolvErINeS and that is too close to penis
zach fackrell
The very term "fight song" needs to be changed too. "Fight" instigates gang violence and rapists. I'm glad someone is finally taking a stand.
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha you guys are great
Brayden Haws
Haha the wenis
That was the winner
Bryan Samuelson
Doubt not fear not Teezer, we'll fight this. I'm with you. It's honestly so ridiculous. Like how did it pass unanimously?
Brayden Haws
ASUU is a shame
Let's riot
Les Mis
That's us
Bryan Samuelson
I feel like there's no way they should have the power to
do that
Brayden Haws
Ideally they should be passing policies that represent the students wants, I doubt almost anyone wanted this
Colby Condie
It was RJ Castleton
Good guesses eddy and Bryan
Tyson Amundsen
He has a new girlfriend. She's quite normal, which is a departure from tradition #thedarknessgirl
Brayden Haws
Black eyes, black dragon
Colby Condie
RJ was sorta waiting for a sister missionary and now he's dating another girl
"I'm conflicted." -RJ
Also, he was wearing a skin tight tank top
Edward Ekstrom
Utah's student body officers have gone rogue
I hope the second coming arrives before they ruin the coolest school in the world.
Merit Egan
I would encourage all of you to get del taco today since it's 3 for a dollar tacos. Take us back to high school
Colby Condie
Wise patriarchal advice
Tyson Amundsen
Question: who among us works on their own car? Like occasionally
Brayden Haws
I've done some stuff on mine. Merit, crawdad
John Sherwood
I change the oil and rotate the tires. And fill it up with gas
Merit Egan
I once did a $550 repair on my car successfully. I bought the part for 50 bucks and did it. Other than that, I have very little car knowledge.
I know where to put windshield washer fluid.
John Sherwood
I think all of us combined, we can fix a car. Tzr, let's fix your car
Merit Egan
Teez, what's the issue?
Brayden Haws
And merit used worse and glue to do it which is even more bad @$$
Merit Egan
It's true, I used gorilla glue to hold my car together.
But I can work with screws too
Tyson Amundsen
It's due to have the automatic transmission fluid replaced. Supposed to happen every 60k miles for my car. I think its doable on my own
Brayden Haws
I think that's better to get done at a shop cause from what I've heard it's hard to get it to fully drain. And they use like a power flusher to clean out any residue or buildup before they refill it
Tyson Amundsen
,
I'll check YouTube and the internet. I feel like that's good advice but I also feel like it could be done
Merit Egan
Macho macho man
April 8, 2014
Attention Excerpt
The time is fast approaching for our semi annual banquet. A venue needs be chosen to house our special event. What does the committee vote for dinner?

Or are we cancelling our event?
Brayden Haws
I move we all go to Hollywood connection instead
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, I did a bunch of work in my motorcycle. You can do that if you YouTube it.
Colby Condie
Will the banquets involve women? If not, let's go somewhere manly with beer and wings
Brayden Haws
I've always wanted to go to hooters
Tyson Amundsen
I propose suspending the banquet until finals are over
Actually when did we actually have it planned?
I don't even know
Brayden Haws
As long as we go to hooters
Tyson Amundsen
#Xcerptsexuality
We'll have to bring Al back for this. He knows stuff about hooters we don't. Like what's good on the menu. Yeah
Brayden Haws
Chicken breast
Minus the chicken
#classichootersjokes
Merit Egan
The banquetwas supposed to be this friday. Do we have a motion to move it until May 2nd?
If that is the case, a saturday feef would certainly be plausible
Brayden Haws
I'll be in California may 2nd
Sadly
I'd hate to miss it
Merit Egan
April 25th, are everyone's finals over?
Brayden Haws
The U's are the next week
Merit Egan
Who is opposed to doing it this friday? From my understanding, that is well before finals and should be just fine
Except for eddy
Tyson Amundsen
Depends on how we want to execute. I work til 7, so if we are thinking like a cool homestyle banquet where we bring things I will probably lack that. But if we just all go to dinner at Rio or wherever I could make 730
Colby will probably be in St. G tho, bear in mind
Bryan I see you
You see me.
Touching me, touching youuuuuuuui Sweet Caroline!
Brayden Haws
Rio
Hasn't been done in ages
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha teezer. I will be at my sisters birthday this Friday
Unfortunately
Tyson Amundsen
I'd do taste of Punjab
Daft Bryan. Hoe about Saturday?
Brayden Haws
Navajo hogan
Bryan Samuelson
Taste of Punjab really is delicious
I have a fellowship activity for my ward on Saturday at 7. I could get out by 8:30
Tyson Amundsen
Merit we need you
Merit Egan
Whenever we do it, I agree with colby. Wings and beer, rootbeer
Edward Ekstrom
I probably can't do this weekend. But my finals are over the 24th so anytime after that
Colby Condie
I can do it anytime. My loyalty is first to the Xcerpt union. All other things come in second priority
#hailxcerpt
zach fackrell
I'm in for after finals.
Or in my case..








tomorrow
Merit Egan
Gooooood
If all of you claim you can't do it this weekend because of finals, I better not hear that any of you do anything fun.
It would undermine xcerpt clause 3-41
zach fackrell
"If any member of 'X'cerpt fail to show up for an event that has heretofore been agreed upon the aforementioned member must surrender any frivolity or fun in substitute of the missed event"
look it up
Tyson Amundsen
Guys eddy is pregnant and Bryan is getting married this weekend. That's why they can't come.
Colby Condie
I solemnly swear that if I don't have fun with members of Xcerpt then I promise to not have fun anywhere.


Long live Xcerpt.

Guys add another one to the list:

I helped a man named Al Cobbledick today. No jokes
Merit Egan
wow, what a last name. I think we should create him in fifa
Brayden Haws
Great plan merit
Colby Condie
"There goes Cobbledick."
Brayden Haws
That can be Jared when he comes back
Merit Egan
haha
Colby Condie
T minus 21 days until Rubinsky returns
Tyson Amundsen
Haha. Cobbledick, a new word for ppl we don't like
"Some cobbledick got 100 on the test. Screw him"
Brayden Haws
So Austin bowyer
Tyson Amundsen
"That cobbledick just cut me off"
Haws exactly
"Only cobbledicks want to change Utah Man"
zach fackrell

Let's be his FB friends
Tyson Amundsen
And make him an administrator of pool party every day
zach fackrell
He'll be the guy who always calls the cops
Colby Condie
That's him Zach!!! Haha
Colby Condie

Here is John. We're at the same branch today. Hard at work or hardly workin?
Workin hard or hardly workin. That sounds better
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
MLS players union released 2014 salary figures. RSL's top 3
1. Saborio $360k
2. Beckerman $350k
3. Javi $300k
Brayden Haws
Tyson I like these financial stats thanks for bringing them up
Tyson Amundsen
I've got more on the way. Brb
Colby Condie
Rimando not top 3? Surprising
Tyson Amundsen
Sorta. He's a great player, but keepers and defenders value is generally less than attacking players. That's what is worth the big time. Especially in MLS with the small salary cap, you need to allocate more resources to goal scorers. Toronto has been terrible for a ling time partially because they put big money into dumb places, spend it all on defenders
Rimando, findley, and borchers all make around $220k
Plata makes $70k, huge steal
Sandoval and velasquez make $48k
Velasquez is probably still on his rookie contract cuz he is worth more
Brayden Haws
What's the league average for a striker?
Starting forwards I guess

Tyson Amundsen
Um not sure. I'll check. But I would bet 85% are the top wage earners on their team
Also that's hilarious haha
Brayden Haws
Mostly I'm interested in knowing where Sabo's salary compares to other top forwards
This is your new life Teezr, statistician
Tyson Amundsen
Keane makes $4 million. Same with Landon. Mages makes $350k
Magee that is.
Obafemi Martins (Seattle) $1.7 mil
Eddie Johnson (DC) $613k
Defoe and Bradley both make $6 million
Cubo Torres (Chivas) $152k
Colby Condie
Is Dempsey the highest paid MLS player?
Tyson Amundsen
Higuain (Colombus) $580k
Blas Perez (FC Dallas) $335k
Dom Dwyer $80k
Zusi $365k
Marco Di Vaio (Montreal) $1.5 mill
Colby Condie
And Tyson in general, I agree with your statement about putting the money into goal scorers. But the amount of games that Rimando has helped us win or played a huge part is high enough that he's top 3 valuable players on RSL
Tyson Amundsen
I won't argue with that
Dempsey then Bradley then Defoe are top three earners
Wondo $600k
Colby Condie
His PK save percentage is ridiculous. Hmmm interesting
What does Dempsey make?
Tyson Amundsen
$6.7 million
RSL's entire roster is probably $2.5 million or so


Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Haha

Let's talk about the wonderlic test at the NFL draft. Who came up with it? What is on it? Is it like an IQ test
Edward Ekstrom
I've never heard of it, what do they do?
Also, I don't get the kate mcpharen joke. Tyson, enlighten us on all things unknown
Tyson Amundsen
Its some kind of multiple choice test. But it seems ppl disagree whether it actually has anything to do with NFL success. Scores came out today, twitter tells me Johnny football did best out of all qbs
Also you'll have to go to the Canzerzz to get more info on that. The real takeaway is all girls wanna get with Zach
Merit Egan
the wonderlic test is some sort of brains test. I don't know much about it, but it is true that people disagree about the relevance
Tyson Amundsen
What is on it?
Colby Condie
Yeah i've heard that NFL test is the stupidest thing with pointless questions
like nothing to do with football
Tyson Amundsen
Let's take it. Can we all take it? I gather its 50 questions multiple choice
We'll score well and get drafted, just like Moneyball

What phrase is grammatically correct in the English language:
Tyson Amundsen
Merit are those real samples?
Colby Condie
a. we were at the park
b. we was at the park
Tyson Amundsen
We could get 51/50 on that
Merit Egan
it claims they are similar styles of q's
Tyson Amundsen
Frank gore scored six out of fifty when he for drafted haha
Merit Egan
also, Colby I would say A is grammatically correct. However, I imagine there could be some strange rule.
I wrote a paper yesterday and I had to keep writing "the Philippines is"
It was unnatural

It's a text vox. She commented on a pic of Zach. Not unusual I believe. What are you not getting eddy?

Oh, I didn't know she commented on a pic.

Ain't never takin' no final ain't never again.
Merit, when are yours done?
Utah people, when are yours done?
Merit Egan
My finals are the week of the 21st
I'd like to party tonight.
Colby Condie
i'd love to party
Edward Ekstrom
What!  That's when mine are.  How do you have spring break and get out the same time?  BYU is the gayest
They should change their fight song to "rise and shout, the gayest are out"
Merit Egan
Utah State is just the coolest
eddy that would surely offend people
just like how Utah's fight song is so sexist
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
This world is the strangest place as of late.
Colby Condie
there's a reason all the richest people in the world are male
and every US president
and most CEOs
Edward Ekstrom
Besides Oprah
Merit Egan
Stephen Colbert will succeed Letterman as the host of the Late Show, but there is now a controversy that all the talk show hosts are white men.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha good on whoever is heading that conspiracy.
Guys I'm debating eating left over wings for dinner.
I mean breakfast.
Is it worth the possible stomach ache?
John Sherwood
I'd for sure eat wings for breakfast.
Edward Ekstrom
Alright, you convinced me
Colby Condie
do it eddy
eggs are good for breakfast, eggs are basically chicken
chicken wings are chicken
chicken=chicken
Edward Ekstrom
Sounds mathematics.
Sound*
John, have you decided which job you're taking?
Fidelity?
Bryan Samuelson

Brayden Haws
I agree with Bryan
John Sherwood
Yes fidelity. I had an "offer call" yesterday and I am having them mull over raising my salary a bit. But I have orientation on the 28th. And I start june 2nd.

Colby Condie
the Last Supper painting is being reserved by the Catholic church in Milan
I saw it in person
Edward Ekstrom
What do you mean being reserved?
Colby Condie
*preserved
Edward Ekstrom
Got it
Colby Condie
the painting itself is actually just on a wall in a church. so it can't be moved but so they have to do tons of precautions to protect it
http://youngcons.com/you-cant-make-this-stuff-up-guess-why-the-university-of-utah-wants-to-change-their-110-year-old-song/

quick read
eddy whats the trick to get rid of dumb ads that pop up on my HP laptop
Edward Ekstrom
Try malware bytes. If that doesn't work, reinstall Windows.
John Sherwood
Zach, when does the pool open?
Merit Egan
tonight?
i heard
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooooo, it's here!
Summer!!!!!!!!!!
Colby Condie
today its seriously warm enough to swim
Merit Egan
Agreed, or we could play fifa inside to stay away from the cold
Colby Condie
oh yes yes of course.
way nice weather outside = perfect fifa days
Merit Egan
haha precisely
I would really like if edward came to feef. We need another striker
If we had Merit, Eddy, and Colby up front, with John, Tyson, and Haws in the midfield (knowing Bsam is busy), we would be unstoppable. Zach or Seth can appear in the midfield if they are available
Colby Condie
eddy the patriarch is summoning his counselor
you must come now
Merit Egan
Let's all carpool to provo and play at Eddy's
Edward Ekstrom
Deal
Merit Egan
Or have eddy drive to John's
Edward Ekstrom
I can't do it.  I have to write some code tonight.  I'm finishing reading a book I was supposed to have read forever ago right now.
Feefster Beefster haha
Colby Condie



Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
I think so
Merit Egan
Ok, what do we do with 6 of us? Tyson, care to make it 7? Haws, care to make it 8? Zach, care to make it 9? and so on
Tyson Amundsen
I'm unlikely
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Zach is in Logan
Merit Egan
I propose Sonnis
John Sherwood
I second sonnis. And spike ball
Merit Egan
I second both
Merit Egan
Ok, since everyone hates fun tonight, we'll move on to tomorrow. As of now, me, John, and Colby and our plus 1's are going to Sawadee for dinner tomorrow. Would anyone else like to join us?
Tyson Amundsen
I've been there before
Merit Egan
Irrelevant
Tyson Amundsen
Buddha was asked "Is God personal or impersonal?"
Buddha replied "It is irrelevant"
Colby Condie
Tyson was once asked by Merit, "would you like to join us for dinner?"

Tyson replied, "I've been there before"

Merit replied, "irreverent"
Colby agreed with merit
Tyson Amundsen
Only a Sith speaks in 3rd person
Colby Condie
Cobbledick
Merit Egan
I've created Cobbledick on fifa, everyone come play.
John Sherwood
We are coming soon. For sonnis. And feef. We'll be there by 8 . Unless we stop for dinner. Then a bit l8r
Colby Condie
Lauren is comin over now to my house. Then we're gonna eat then come over probably
Brayden Haws

Did his kid draw this?
Colby Condie
Comin hot merit
Saturday, April 12, 2014 10:07 AM
John Sherwood
Where is everyone watching the real game?
Tyson Amundsen
I will most certainly watch it. Probability at my house, you can join. Post game we could play tennis around here or slack
John Sherwood
I'd do that
Bryan Samuelson
I'm just at work all day, can't have any fun
Merit Egan
Gay
Tyson, why no fifa anymore? Did you break up with feef?
Brayden Haws
I'm here for all find
Funs
Tyson Amundsen
I love a good feef, but I also love other things. Polyamourous
Merit Egan
Haws, feef?
2 o'clock
Brayden Haws
Mert that's when the game starts
Post RSL?
John Sherwood
Post. Tzr, I'll be over at 2
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly Haws. Also I propose a newer edition of FIFA is needed. We are too good at that one
Good john
Colby Condie
Tyson I love merits FIFA. I can actually score
I had a great goal last night. Great goal
Merit Egan
Oh is was savory Colby
Tyson Amundsen
That's great news. I feel we can live a higher law. Sanctify yourself Colby
Merit Egan
Tyson, let us try to go back to rsl and make so our players are like 65 overall.
Brayden Haws
Bryan's feef is really the key, if we can master that we'll be the best ever
Tyson Amundsen
Both valid points. I'd try it merit. They might be pretty bad and frustrate us. But we shall see
Tyson Amundsen
Zach are we supposed to like a photo of yours so you can win?
Brayden Haws
I feel like in soccer announcers can use any term for anything that happens and it sounds cool and legit
Tyson Amundsen
True Haws. Another tie that feels like a loss, we shoulda had that game
Brayden Haws
I can't believe we have up that edu goal
FML
Tyson Amundsen
Yup
I also feel we were lucky to not give up a penalty, based on the whole cumulative stuff
Edward Ekstrom
Fuh
Tyson Amundsen
2-2
Brayden Haws
That was for sure a dive by them at the end but I'm also surprised they didn't give it to em
Edward Ekstrom
John and colb are at flat iron
What are you guys doing there?
Colby Condie
Slack lining
Tis the season.
I just left though. Teez and john are still there
Tyson Amundsen
Haws did you know our stake center got vandalized a bit ago? They broke in, stole the tvs from the library, ripped those wall pads down in the gym, and spray painted the halls and walls inside the chapel
3rd building in sandy in the last few months to be hit
The one by quail hollow, for the rest of you
Edward Ekstrom
Wtf
Do they have any clues who it is?
Brayden Haws
No I didn't know that? Wtf man who's doing that
God will smite them, we'll smite them
The gun show is in town lets go
Edward Ekstrom
Your bod is the permanent gun show
Tyson Amundsen
I know man, we need to be the Mormon Mafia
I don't think they have suspects
Saturday, April 12, 2014 11:04 PM
Edward Ekstrom
I sleep with a gun next to me all the time now because we came home the other day and our metal door was bent.
Someone tried to jam something where the doorknob is and pry it open
Brayden Haws
Fug them man, shoot them
Edward Ekstrom
And if they ever get it they are going to get a nasty surprise.
Merit Egan
What are the legal ramifications if you shoot someone breaking in?
Edward Ekstrom
If they are in your house and a "reasonable person" would feel like their life is in danger, none.
But if they don't have a weapon you can't really shoot them
Brayden Haws
Just knew cap em
Edward Ekstrom
Just scare the bahjebus out of them.
Brayden Haws
Knee cap
Merit Egan
Yes, that is what I remember. The reasonable person...
So what if it is dark and you say you couldn't see a weapon
Edward Ekstrom
Then I probably wouldn't shoot them.
You could get screwed, which is gay anyway because they are in your house.
Merit Egan
Seriously, those fags
Edward Ekstrom
http://le.utah.gov/code/TITLE76/htm/76_02_040700.htm
Tyson Amundsen
Queers
Edward Ekstrom
So I may be wrong, it sounds like if it is your "property of habitation"
Tyson Amundsen
Smear 'em
Edward Ekstrom
You can use deadly force
And you can in a few other situations as we'll
From that law it sounds like if they enter by breaking in or are even trying to break in, you are allowed to use deadly force.
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Hahhahahahaha
Sunday, April 13, 2014 11:17 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Merit and Zach, remember that guy in our ward who would bump his huge belly into us when we were gathering fat offerings?
Brother Fox?
zach fackrell
Hahah yep.
I think his name was fox or something
Edward Ekstrom
Flox?
zach fackrell
Haha yep
Fox
Merit Egan
Haha sometimes I wonder what was going through his mind. Using your belly to pin young 12 year old boys in the corner at your house...
Edward Ekstrom
Seriously, did he want to go to prison?
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/nztzwMiQTaI
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
I would kill myself
Monday, April 14, 2014 9:38 AM

Them*
Monday, April 14, 2014 1:44 PM
John Sherwood
58k boys.
Merit Egan
Take it! we could buy house upon house upon house!
except only like 1/5 of a house
Edward Ekstrom
We could buy a car.
Merit Egan
true
Edward Ekstrom
or 2 priuses
or like 5 motorcycles
sweet ones.
Merit Egan
we could buy like 25 scooters
John Sherwood
Someone pick me up in exactly 20 minutes
In an unmarked vehicle
Merit Egan
I'm unscrewing my license plates now
and painting the tracker green
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
I'll use google locations to find you
Tyson Amundsen
How much does a hipster weigh?
Brayden Haws
They probably don't believe in weight #newage
#jokeruiner
Tyson Amundsen
Haha close. True answer: an instagram
Edward Ekstrom
Ha
Brayden Haws
haha great joke
outstanding
Merit Egan
very good, very good. Also, very true, very true
Colby Condie
Haha john when I saw your $58k google vox I thought you were talking about your new salary with Fidelity until I just saw the pic
John Sherwood
That would be a nice start up salary. Nice indeed
Tyson Amundsen
#CST
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Fidelity pays in all cash.
Stacks on stacks.
Brayden Haws
they just give you a briefcase full of cash at the end of everyweek
Edward Ekstrom
then you return the briefcase at the beginning of the next week so they don't run out of them.
Colby Condie
Or you can choose to have a yearly cash deposit chucked on your doorstep every Jan 1
Brayden Haws
just closets full of briefcases at your house
Colby Condie
Just a suitcase full of 100s
Tyson Amundsen
The purge
Colby Condie
The surge
zach fackrell
The purge???
Anyone wanna see robocop at the dollars tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
Zach, street soccer is going down at 930 in a parking garage in salt lake. Let's go to that instead
Colby Condie
Guys here's gonna be a full lunar eclipse tonight at 1:45AM
Brayden Haws
it should have a rosy hue
my main man Neil de Grasse Tyson was tweeting about it
Colby Condie
Haws lets get rancheritos at 1 then watch it on your roof top
Like old times
Brayden Haws

Edward Ekstrom
How come I can't save gifs?
Tyson Amundsen
Did the jazz win
Brayden Haws
No they got killed
Swaggy P
Edward Ekstrom
The Jazzers are not too hot this year. But to hot to be in the bottom three... Not a great position to be in.
They're like that poop that you know is going to smell really terrible but you want to take it anyway cause is going to feel great. So you sit down to take it, but nothing comes out...
Brayden Haws
I was reading this article that I gotta find again about how getting a top pick is almost never a good idea to win in the future. Like in the whole nba history, teams who got the #1 only like 5 of them have ever won a championship
Merit Egan
If we finish 4th worst, we are in a great spot to get a top 3 pick and can't do worse than 7th. We just need to lose our last games now.
Tyson Amundsen
Good. Did anyone see the Orange moon last night
Colby Condie
I did
It was rad
Merit Egan
I was sleeping away and did not see it
Edward Ekstrom
Was it really orange?
Colby Condie
It was a pretty dark orange color
Not vibrant or anything
zach fackrell
Orange moon was way cool
Tyson Amundsen
Ok, about to enter a boring class. Help a teezer out and link some good articles for me to read
Edward Ekstrom
Help a teezer out

Tyson Amundsen
Thank you condor
I just got to it, its an interesting article. I'm about halfway thru
Bryan Samuelson
I'm working with Paul Kline today, he's been asking about y'all.
"You guys had a tight knit little group!"
#Xcerpt
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes. Since when did he work at UPS?
Bryan Samuelson
Since august.... Of 2008
Brayden Haws
Dood yeah he works by my parents house sometimes, I've seen him there before my mission
Tyson Amundsen
Bwahaha oh dear... Bryan you don't belong there
Colby Condie
Yeah man Paul Kline has helped me a couple times at the UPS on 9400 south
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan you work there?
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah Ed. Not at 9400, but up by John's house
Merit Egan
Paul Kline once said he was me to the cops. I'm sure they figured it out, but since that time...
John had that happen from someone else right?
Brayden Haws
No wonder he's asking so much about us, probably trying to figure out of merits in jail
John Sherwood
Ha ya casey scheide did it to me. Hilarious
Tyson Amundsen
Guys when we get in trouble with the cops who should we pretend to be
Brayden Haws
Austin bowyer
Tyson Amundsen
Dude yes
Colby Condie
I'll say I'm Gomez
John Sherwood
I'll be blayne baker. Gomez gay lover
Colby Condie

Found this on the teller line at Tooele Zions branch today
Bryan Samuelson
Bahehehe

Hahahehehoho
Merit Egan
Haha, John's own writing. Yet so accurate.
Tyson Amundsen
Hardyhardyhar
John Sherwood
That's real life funny
Tyson Amundsen
Sandytown ppl, anyone want to party tonight?
Merit Egan
I would like to know if I am considered a sandytown person.
zach fackrell
Yes you are and yes we do!!
Tyson Amundsen
Merit, I'm at work now. I could actually come to your house on the way home. Feefa? Gravity? Zach hey dude. Bryan? Colbinski?
Bryan Samuelson
I can't. I have to go work on a group project
Merit Egan
How late do you work teez?
Tyson Amundsen
I get off when I pleez.
Colby Condie
Just got home a bit ago from work. I could maybe party
Edward Ekstrom
Come to provo anyone, I passed off my last group project, now no classes left just finals! ! ! Ayooooooooo

Tyson, pay me the big bucks and I will
Colby Condie
Did they pay you for that eddy
Edward Ekstrom
Paid me with an A
Colby Condie
Kick their A's until they pay you
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
Well done eddy. I wish I remembered what my map was like. That looks way nice though.
I use USU Banner and it kind of sucks. Same thing slcc uses
Edward Ekstrom
Gracias everyone. Is probably just like Utah states. Pretty much all university registration systems such
Suck
Merit Egan
I doth agree
Now make me a code for my recruiting business that automatically inputs information from LinkedIn into an Excel Spreadsheet. How hard would that be?
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know.
If linked in has a public api, I bet it would be pretty easy.
But if it doesn't it would be very difficult
Merit Egan
Hmmmm. I would likely be willing to pay you a nice side pot of fifa bucks (real money, usd) if it was a nice and quick process.
John Sherwood
My allergies are flaring up like the gosh dang 4th of july. I'd pay you a ton of fifa bucks to write a program for that
Colby Condie
Still John? Mine are kinda gone now. I had it bad for a few days
Edward Ekstrom
Mine have been terrible too. Merit I'll look to see how difficult it would be. If it's easy, I'll do it for free. If it's hard, I probably won't do it haha
John Sherwood
Today was public enemy number one
Merit Egan
Haha, that's fair.

those Jewish entrepreneurs have always been cutthroat devils. Watch your back Jeffrey
Merit Egan
Excellent Jeff. In the summer i will be in a few entrepreneurial classes as well. We will just start the biggest bad a** company ever. Tyson will be our in office doctor to take care of all of our medical expenses.
Edward Ekstrom
This was my untouched hair this morning. Don't know who, don't know why, don't know how but this happened
Merit Egan
#sexhair
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha awesome
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, little secret. You don't get that hair when your wife is first pregnant because she's just nauseous all the time.
Merit Egan
noted.
pregnancy is a cock blocker
Brayden Haws
My wife is never getting pregnant then
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Brayden Haws
Blue balls for months
I ain't about that
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
that's definitely not desirable
Edward Ekstrom
Haws I'm sure your human sexuality class said it's healthier to higher an escort for situations like that and that any monogamous couple is going to die an early and painful death.
Merit Egan
haha, that class has just taught us so many improper things
Edward Ekstrom
Guys I missed my free jamba on Monday and wept..
That will never happen again. Mark my words
Merit Egan
Yesterday I wanted a Jamba, but Kelli didn't, but she came with me, so I got 2 free Jambas.
Edward Ekstrom
Lucky
In need to install isis on my work android
Merit Egan
"Now I have 2 toasters"
Stanley - The Office
Edward Ekstrom
So we can get 2
There's a jamba right by our house, it's awesome. And a del taco and McDonald's
So I buy 1$ things all the time
Merit Egan
so if you buy a 1$ thing at mcdonalds, you get a dollar back right?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
And del taco
Merit Egan
haha. Just free
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Merit Egan
WTF
DEL Freaking TACO@
why didn't i know they had Isis
Edward Ekstrom
They do
And rite aid which is also right by my house
But one time I tried going to McDonald's, getting a dollar thing, eating it, then getting another dollar thing and it declined
I don't know why
Merit Egan
ah, I would like to try that
Edward Ekstrom
Maybe because they knew my plan
Merit Egan
It works at Barbacoa
but perhaps they wised up with mcdonalds
Edward Ekstrom
Really
Merit Egan
Yeah, I've swiped my phone 3 times in a row at Barbacoa before
lunch for the whole office
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
I bet Tyson is losing it since we're talking about Isis so much. He hates irrelevant convo
Edward Ekstrom
Oh it's relevant
Edward Ekstrom
Del taco also gives you a free taco when you pay with isis
Merit Egan
This is too much
imagine taco tuesday. 3 tacos for FREE, plus a 4th
4 tacos for FREE
Tyson, can you hear us! FREE
Edward Ekstrom
I just got 3 hard shells for 27¢
Merit Egan
That's 9¢ a taco
Colby Condie
Upon reading the google voxes from today, I've leaned a lot about sex in marriage life
Thanks guys
Tyson Amundsen
Since you have been going ham for awhile I just muted my notifications for a few hours to do physics homework. so I hold no ill will for however many voxes you just did
here's a question
you know how that program that runs encryption on the internet had a problem? is it really necessary for us to change our passwords everywhere
Merit Egan
the heartbleed virus
From what I understand, it hasn't been an issue in the U.S. and hasn't stolen any passwords. They do however anticipate that it could begin to become an issue, but changing your passwords now won't help much
Cause it would just steal it in the future
Edward Ekstrom
Well most sites applied the patch (aka. fixed the bug) and so for those sites if you change your password it won't be stolen again
So for anything you have important stuff on, I would change your password
Online banking password
email
etc
when I say most sites I say most popular sites.
google, gmail and such
they fixed it
also most banks have already fixed it
Merit Egan
Yes, but very few sites have reported actually being hacked right?
Edward Ekstrom
Correct
But they wouldn't know if the hacker is good
Merit Egan
true
Colby Condie
I changed my Venmo password cause they recommended it. That's the only password I've changed so far
Merit Egan
some company in Canada had thousands of social security numbers stolen
Colby Condie
Ha. Canadians
Merit Egan
or some other important number, I can't remember for sure, but it was like 9,000
Tyson Amundsen
So ed and merit you would recommend changing passwords
Edward Ekstrom
For you bank stuff, I would.
Merit Egan
For things that have bank stuff
haha
well said ed
Edward Ekstrom
Also for your email because if your email is hacked they can reset your password for all other sites.
Merit Egan
Yes, just to be safe. However, I do imagine a company with as much information and users as Google would advise everyone to change their passwords if they thought there was any threat. I don't imagine google would have been compromised, but you never know.
John Sherwood
Brooke butterfield (took ed to a dance) just followed me on insta.

Jumanji Zach
Colby Condie

Is that eddy in SLC?
Thursday, April 17, 2014 8:00 AM
Merit Egan
Past midnight? A strip club, that's the only answer. Eddy works at a strip club.
Edward Ekstrom
Wtf, why did it say I was in slc?
Colby Condie
Jabari is going to the NBA. #mormons
Tyson Amundsen
How does everyone feel about that
Colby Condie
I like it. He's ready. He has the shooting ability of a guard and the size and post play of a forward.
In college he could play position 1 thru 5 successfully and in NBA he can play 3 or 4 positions and do well I think.
Edward Ekstrom
I think he should have gone on a mission.
Colby Condie
Agreed eddy
Or maybe his mission is the NBA. He'll be exposed to many more people when he's famous
Tyson Amundsen
I see that point Colby, but its really not the same thing
Colby Condie
Agreed Teezr
Merit Egan
I would agree with Colby's point. Based on interviews with Jabari, I think he has a good head on his shoulders and a solid testimony. That would point me to believe that the NBA would do more good than a mission. Although I can see the argument from both sides.
Edward Ekstrom
NBA + mission
Why couldn't he have done that?
I mean look at us, we went in missions and will be examples in the workplace
Merit Egan
Every missionary in his mission would be worthless. All they would be able to say is, "Jabari Parker is in our mission".
Tyson Amundsen
It's an interesting topic. His NBA teammates and coaches will be most affected by his lifestyle because they will be with him day in and day out. I would think any sharing of the gospel would be mostly with them. Maybe reporters or athletic trainers would get to know him that way too. Most NBA fans will know he is Mormon, but idk that they will know more than that. There will be an occasional article about how his faith affects his career as well
Ed makes a good point. Merit you keep writing and erasing things
Merit Egan
Agreed. Ultimately, him being a top 3 pick is huge. It will gain a lot of attention and he will have it brought up in a lot of interviews and things. He's already been on the cover of SI and had major articles written about his faith. If he could go on a mission without slipping in the draft, the argument becomes stronger.
Although if he were to go on a mission and slip down to 7th or 8th, that would be a big fall in terms of people awareness
Edward Ekstrom
True, but if he went then came back to college for a year he could probably be top 3 right?
Merit Egan
That would be the assumption. However, Gardner Meads went from being a McDonald's All American, going on a mission, and then came back and was never good again. Couldn't do anything in college. That obviously wouldn't happen to Jabari to that extent, but there could be some downturn
*Garner Meads
Brayden Haws
Didn't Shawn Bradley play in college, go on a mission, and then just declare for the draft as soon as he got back? Basically teams had to just draft him on faith and individual workouts and that worked out okay for him. But each player is different. I'd say Jabari is doing what is best for his financial future, and really only he and god can know if it's best for his spiritual future
Tyson Amundsen
That's interesting about Bradley. In regards to knowing what's best about Jabari its true we can't know. The direction of priesthood leaders (prophets/apostles/bishops?) also applies. And that counsel is all worthy and able young men should serve
Personal Line and Priesthood Line
Brayden Haws
Well of course but how do we know what his bishop is told him? I would say the general answer is he should serve a mission but also I don't know if we, not being in his position can say that is the right choice for him
Colby Condie
All true points bretheren. This is a highly interesting topic. Like merit said, Jabari is extremely faithful in the church and he actually attended institute while attending Duke. I'm sure he spoke a lot with his bishop and his dad about it all. Considering all we know about him and stuff, this decision wasn't easy I bet. He met with Coach K and talked extensively about it so I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
Coach K knows the most of any coach. I trust what Jabari is doing
Merit Egan
Yes, 2 months ago, the news was that Jabari's people were asking NBA teams if they would still draft him in the top 3, 5, or 10 this year, if he were to go on a mission and then join the team after. Much like teams draft a european player and then wait a few years to actually sign them.
The point being that he was looking at every situation and was counseling with the Lord, bishop, coach, family, etc.
I trust that he followed the Spirit. After all, would Pres. Monson quote Jabari if he didn't agree with what he was doing?
Tyson Amundsen
It seems clear Jabari will become prophet in 2035, after turning down a job at TNT
Merit Egan
On another note, I was reading on the church website about the church's stance on a bunch of issues. The one on abortion had a line that was extremely interesting. allow me to post it
"As far as has been revealed, a person may repent and be forgiven for the sin of abortion."
No other issues contain that clause, which is crazy to me because the church is keeping the option open to place abortion as an unforgivable sin.
I thought it was interesting for them to throw that in there. Quite bold.
Brayden Haws
Merit that is a super interesting find
I think it serves too purposes, I feel like in the church that is somewhat already looked upon as being unforgivable and not something that can ever be allowed, so this may help to clear up that stigma, as well as, doing as you have stated
Bryan Samuelson
Intriguing Mert. Guys I just caught up, great discussion on Jabari. I wish he would have gone on a mission. I wish he would have stayed at Duke. I wish him the best in the NBA. I'm very impressed by the way he's handled everything. Seems very considerate and sincere
Merit Egan
I agree Haws. That is probably the more likely purpose and ultimately probably will be forgivable, but they don't make assumptions.
Bryan Samuelson
Well said on the abortion issue as well
Edward Ekstrom
Good find about abortion mert. As per Jabari, that is true, maybe Heavenly Father really wanted him I'm the NBA but from my point of view mission trumps all and he should have gone. Forgive me if I'm wrong.
But it's always easier being an outsider to say what someone should do.
Tyson Amundsen
I'm with eddy in reality. If you're worthy and able, that's the proscribed pattern.
My Google vox is behaving like real vox- its lagging
Edward Ekstrom
Turning down millions of dollars, the spirit might tell me to stay home too haha
Tyson Amundsen
Also the abortion stuff is interesting. The abortion question calls for a mission presidency interview for baptism
Edward Ekstrom
True
Tyson Amundsen
I ran into that twice with investigators
Brayden Haws
What does able mean? Physically? Mentally? Could having another opportunity to provide financial stability to your family and be a pr boost to the church qualify someone as unable?
Tyson Amundsen
Able being the keyword. My dad jokes about personality tests as necessary (based on some of our companions we see why), which is funny. It for sure means physically and mentally beyond doubt.
I wonder what the brethren would say to that one Haws. They are the ones who are qualified to answer that, as far as PR goes. What do you think?
Brayden Haws
I think that's basically the point of all the Jabari date is that we all know the basic guidelines and standards of who should serve. But none of us actually know what Jabari went thru to make his decision and what counsel he may have had from his bishop and perhaps even the brethren
Date = debate
Merit Egan
Another point is the quote that says something like "the most important work will be the work you do in your own home". That would trump missionary work. Perhaps this is a moment that could trump missionary work.
Much like there are guidelines, but direct intervention from the Lord can overrules those guidelines. Nephi slaying Laban...
Tyson Amundsen
That's the best point right there merit. That's why you're the patriarch
Merit Egan
Ultimately, I would say that I am open to the fact the Jabari could have received a real answer from the Lord telling him to stay home
Tyson Amundsen
And you're the oldest
And first to get married
Colby Condie
All very true. I mean it's not often that the prophet quotes and mentions Jabari in general conference. I wouldn't be surprised if Pres Monson and Jabari spoke personally about his decision to stay home and go to the NBA
Brayden Haws
I agree with merit. He very well could have been told to stay. Also consider if he had gone, you supposed to devote all you time and thoughts to serving The Lord, that's hard to do if you know you need to stay in peak basketball condition and skills for two years. It'd be easy to get distracted or lose sight of your purpose as a missionary
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not worried about the second part
Merit Egan
Agreed, not to mention the distraction to the other missionaries
Brayden Haws
Like think how distracted we would get thinking about glum to school or seeing our families or friends. Those are easy solutions cause no matter what you do when you get back those things will be there. Whereas with him if he's not staying at the top of his game he may lose his opportunity all together
Tyson Amundsen
What were you gonna say before that? Also, I'm still not worried about that
The distraction to others would be major tho
Brayden Haws
You're not worried that he would go on a mission and potentially waste two years being too distracted by basketball to whole heartedly serve?
I feel like that could very well be a possibility and if that was the case I'd stay if I was him and just work on basketball
Tyson Amundsen
Nope. Boiling it down to the roots, all missionaries battle that in one way or another
That won't change for the rest of his life either
Or any of ours. Covenants are all about placing the Lord first, so whether he is in the mission field, in the NBA, as a TV analyst, a youth coach, or whatever
To me its the same
Brayden Haws
And I think you're right in all cases The Lord should be first, I'm also saying I just don't think (for whatever reasoning) we can say that he wasn't supposed to go. That's known only to him and The Lord
Merit Egan
Yes, a mission is in no way a saving ordinance. It does more for the missionary in terms of establishing the faith and a testimony. If Jabari can live his life in accordance with the gospel, there won't be any recoils from not serving a mission in the end.
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I don't think anyone is saying that, I'm certainly not.
Merit Egan
And that is what makes it possible that he could have received an answer telling him not to go, even though he is an able male
Tyson Amundsen
I am saying worrying about serving with all your heart isn't the issue
Good long merit
Haha *point
Merit Egan
Haws has been right though. We don't and can't know if he made the right decision in accordance with the Lord.
I bet he did though
Good old Jabari
Tyson Amundsen
Yep. The real problem is I haven't concentrated on my fiscals very well at all for like more than an hour
Colby Condie
This has been an intriguing and wonderful topic to discuss
Brayden Haws
I haven't done any work today,
Thanks to this
I mean thanks in a sincere way
Colby Condie
Considering how famous Jabari already is, maybe the prophet or Lord counseled him not to go. With such a wide audience that the NBA has (even worldwide) it could be possible that he would never serve a real mission. Obviously Tyson that's the most important thing is honoring our covenants and priesthood duties. But in this case, I guarantee he wouldn't be treated the same as other missionaries. Everywhere he goes, the media will know about it and people will know
Colby Condie
http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-basketball/news/20140417/jabari-parker-declares-for-nba-draft/
guys this is a tremendous video of Jabari's interview w/ SI, he discusses a mission at like 2:20
and jabari wrote the piece below too
Tyson Amundsen
Jabari is important,but the more pressig matter is Utah Man. Tomo ASUU has a bill saying "we support changing the fight song" and stuff. Which we don't. The bill passing would just put pressure on the committee's above them to change it
Edward Ekstrom
I don't think it goes...
Tyson Amundsen
Therefore I call on all men everywhere to drop a quick line saying no
Edward Ekstrom
I also think even if they do end up changing it, the fans will still sing utah man
Tyson Amundsen
Especially Bryan
Edward Ekstrom
to spite the idiots who changed it.
Colby Condie
I heard that the ASUU has very little say in changing the fight song
Tyson Amundsen
It's a matter of principle tho eddy. We don't want it changed
Colby that's true. They don't make the decision. But they have the power to get the front page of all newspapers in the state and the news on TV
Which adds lots of pressure
Pressure for ppl to look open minded
Edward Ekstrom
"I didn't prepare myself off the court as much as I should have because everything was basketball related and to say that I'm going to leave and turn my life spiritual I'm going to be unprepaired."
unprepared*
Colby Condie
yeah eddy that was the crucial line
Jabari basically said he is not spiritually ready to commit to a mission. Basketball has taken a good chunk of his attention and focus away from church matters
Edward Ekstrom
He does seem like a great guy, but from what he said it doesn't seem like a leader or the spirit told him not to go.
Yeah Colby, that's what it seems.
Colby Condie
But you're right eddy. no doubt jabari is a very mature and respectful person. i love how he is still going to be enrolled at duke and graduate while playing in the nba
nobody does that these days anymore.
Edward Ekstrom
That is cool.
Friday, April 18, 2014 1:07 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Ps. Sports illustrated is the worst.
Edward Ekstrom
Also merit, I want to clarify what I said earlier. When I said mission trumps all I meant all worldly pursuits. You were absolutely right that it's not an ordinance necessary for salvation. Ordinances really do trump all. I just mean there's good better best. Good= playing in the nba and being a good media example, better= going on a mission and hopefully being many to ordinances of salvation, best= saving yourself and others with ordinances like being sealed. Props to John on doing the best of the three even though he could have done any. NBA, mission or marry Julia in August.
Bringing*
zach fackrell
Well said.
This was a cool convo today.
*yesterday
Edward Ekstrom
I'm just zeezler tonight, can't sleep.
zach fackrell
Haha It's not so bad.
It just sucks when it's every night. Why can't you sleep? You're done with skewl right?
Edward Ekstrom
Nope final in the morning. But mostly I can't sleep because I have a really important idea in my head.
zach fackrell
What's the idea?
Edward Ekstrom
Namely, warning humanity about the dangers of pornography when so many are gaining internet access and those who already have it are spending more and more time in it.
There are public health campaigns that warn people about the damage smoking causes to the physical body.
But there are no such campaigns warning people about the damages pornography causes to the spiritual body.
Even from a non-religious standpoint, I think people should be made aware you know?
zach fackrell
Dude there's lots of stuff out there. People have talked at my home ward recently about lots of studies about the physical, spiritual and mental issues corresponding to pornography.
The chemical side effects in the brain are the most interesting. Jan garbett has an organization called "women for decency" they are trying to pass laws in America to get a better handle on media content.
Edward Ekstrom
That's good but I like a more informative approach instead of a banning approach.
Like smoking, anyone who starts smoking nowadays at least knows what they're getting themselves into.
But they can still do it if they choose.
If the laws they are trying to pass are to inform, then I think that is freakin awesome.
zach fackrell
Ya man I need to show you a book they gave out at this fireside. It's pure information about this whole thing.
Edward Ekstrom
He restore my soul?
zach fackrell
Ya thats a good one. I'll have to get you more information about this other one.
Edward Ekstrom
Do it. Alright, I'm going to try to sleep. I bet everyone is mad about their phones buzzing hags
zach fackrell

Edward Ekstrom
Merit a great ideal. I'll call it "fight pornography with clothes"
It'll be just like national geographic putting target clothes on Afrikaans
Merit Egan
Haha, we should make them blurry clothes, so then people are like "why is it blurry, they are wearing clothes"
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy did you see the vox this morning? #listen&learn
John Sherwood
Hashtag from brother claytons talk last aprils conference ya?
Actually his is watch and learn
Tyson Amundsen
Way to be Mormon john, I actually had forgotten that. I just want eddy to comment about scrub wearing at BYU campus
Merit Egan
All those people that wear scrubs are probably CNA's. All they do is wipe butts. I know, cause I did it.
At the hospital, it was extremely rare to see anyone remotely our age doing anything other than the lowest of the low work. therefore, all those individuals wearing scrubs are just showing off that they know how to "scrub" butts
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
One time this fat lady made me wipe her butt.
Then she yelled at me cause I brought her sprite instead of sprite zero
It was a bad night
Colby Condie
Haha
Guys im working in west valley today. West side is no good. A guy came in today and literally his brain was so fried from drugs he couldn't speak sentences. He kept making noises at me. This old lady was with him and telling me what he needed. Then he called her a name and she got mad and they left
I knew he was drugged cause the lady told me

Guys, this conversation has not been renamed in ages. Props to colby for his great naming skills. He would for sure win an award if we had a banquet.
Colby Condie
I truly appreciate this recognition from our patriarch. I would love to have a real banquet sometime
Brayden Haws
Colby's Bachelor Banquet Blowout brought to you by: HOOTERS
Followed a week later by Johns Jentlemen Bachelor Banquet: sponsor to be named

Teezr I'll take one order of fun
Alex Platis
I'll have a side of Brooke Foster. Hold the clothes.
zach fackrell




Alex Platis
What does that mean zeez? That she has a twin who is also on the menu?
zach fackrell
Haha I'll investigate.. Fun fact- who knew Brooke foster worked at settebellos?
Alex Platis
This guy ️but stalkers probably don't count
I was referring to me. The pointing finger is confusing.
Brayden Haws
She's also a bartender and is rich, Al's sugar mama
Tyson Amundsen
*Teezer's
Brayden Haws
So any partying tonight?
Edward Ekstrom
I've been swimmin all day probably do the same tonight
Brayden Haws
Has anyone been watching the Brooklyn game? The refs aren't calling anything
Saturday, April 26, 2014 9:00 AM
John Sherwood
I have nothing today. I'd do any of the following: morning feef, matinee movie, mid morning feef, basketball, ping pong/4 square, billiards, afternoon feef, afternoon delight, bowling, etc..
Storm chase, hike
Church games
Edward Ekstrom
No afternoon delight until August 14th
That's the day right?
John Sherwood
13th.. so ya 14th for that
I'll cross that off the list today.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Colby Condie
Good morning bretheren
Merit Egan
Good morning. I 2nd all of John's ideas.
Brayden Haws
I have work but after it I support all of johns ideas
Tyson Amundsen

Bryan, tell Wayno I appreciate his support
Merit Egan
I hope the pacers lose and fire Vogel. Then the Jazz can hire him.
zach fackrell
Goooooood morning I also second all johns ideas. I'm ready I'm here . Let's friend party today
Colby Condie
just saw a world cup commercial for team USA and i'm pumped
Colby Condie
eddy did you hear about that contest that offered $25,000 to the first hacker that could write a virus for Mac OS X software?
John Sherwood
Are we partying?
Bryan Samuelson
Unfortunately I won't be able to party until the night time
Colby Condie
we're doing a late bday dinner in lehi for mia madre tonight. maybe i can party after depending on what we do and where
zach fackrell
What about real feef fake feef?
Merit Egan
I'd like that.
John Sherwood
Id real feef. Then tonight ReAl feef
Merit Egan
Like at 5 or 6, prior to the game? With some breakfast burritos
John Sherwood
I'll pat myself on the back for that one. That's good
Colby Condie
ha good john
zach fackrell
I like this plan. Anything before fake feef? Play in the rain. Explore big cottonwood. Make a video in the mountains. Go watch captain America matinée?
John Sherwood
I'll do the prior
zach fackrell
Play in the rain
Feef in the rain
Edward Ekstrom
Colby I didn't hear about that.that's crazy.
But I bet if they can wore a virus for Mac osx they could make much more than 25,000
Colby Condie
Is it really that hard to write a virus for Mac software eddy?
Edward Ekstrom
No idea. It would be hard to write one that runs without the users permissionbut but a lot of viruses count on the user just clicking accept to install crap
Merit Egan
Are we partying with Jeff tonight?
Brayden Haws

Did you guys see conveys wood hat?
Merit Egan
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Donald Sterling owns the Clippers I believe. What did he say that has lead to uproar recently? I keep seeing him being mentioned on twitter
Merit Egan
He was recorded talking to his girlfriend on the phone. She has taken a picture with Magic Johnson and posted it on instagram. He told her not to promote being with black people and not to bring them to his games.
And a bunch of other racist things
Tyson Amundsen
What will the repercussions be
You can't oust an owner...
We probably could, we could oust anyone #joooooosh
Merit Egan
Haha I know. I hope the clippers team all quits
John Sherwood
Feef merit?
Merit Egan
Indeed
zach fackrell
On our way
Merit Egan
Good
Merit Egan

Matisyahu - Jerusalem w/Lyrics: http://youtu.be/ruBEraXm_GA
Jeff, watch this every morning.
#remember
Tyson Amundsen
The Hebrew words urim and thummim, both plural, mean Lights and Perfections
Brayden Haws
Some people have theorized that all the stones the brother of Jared made were used as urim and thummin
The rlds claims to have one of them
Tyson Amundsen
I've not heard that. The reorgs? Like one of the brother of jareds or just one in general
Jeff Knudsen
Yes Eddy, that is a way good tune.  We had that as a theme song over there.  I shant forget
Tyson Amundsen
The community of Christ, erstwhile reorgs
Brayden Haws
Just in general
Tyson Amundsen
What's your thoughts on the jaredite theory of urim and thummim?
Merit Egan
Football season is back!
Colby Condie
Haha
Also Tyson have you seen that Nike soccer commercial
It's way sweet. The new one
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah man, Nike usually does good ones
Brayden Haws
Merit great joke
Tyson Amundsen
Drew Gooden?? I thought he played in Cleveland??
DREW GOODEN??
Brayden Haws
Plays for wizards now
He played for Cleveland and then went to Milwaukee where he had a shaved head and a rat tail
Alex Crawford
I was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see...it's good to be back my friends. After a brief abstinence from the hangout I have done the work I set out to do and freely welcome all distractions now that all things academic are finished. Huzzah!
Colby Condie
Welcome back Crawdad
Tyson Amundsen
You call that brief?
Alex Crawford
I have an eternal perspective on life.
Sunday, April 27, 2014 8:41 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Back home in provo. The AZ trip was a welcome break from work and school. Back to school tomorrow. Jeff are you doing spring?
Monday, April 28, 2014 11:19 AM
Edward Ekstrom

You guys are close to each other
Colby Condie
What the? Why does it say I'm at draper park
I'm home right now.
Merit Egan
haha shoot man, come visit me
I can run over to the park and see if there is something fishy happening
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know, it's off sometime.
Merit Egan
some guy dressed like colby and using your gmail
Colby Condie
Haha
I did drive past there last night though coming home from Lauren's house
Edward Ekstrom
John, any news on your interviews?
Merit, I think our free jambas expire at the end of the month..
Merit Egan
I'm so sad. Rumor has it that barbacoa will be releasing a new deal in may.
that would make me happy
So fellas, what is everyone doing this weekend. I would like to try and celebrate Kelli's birthday on Saturday with everyone. Perhaps do a BBQ, and maybe look into renting a big blow up obstacle course or something. Would people be able to come play?
It won't be a surprise party, just a friendly gathering
Edward Ekstrom
We could!
John Sherwood
Interviews went well.. I want goldman. But if that doesn't work, fidelity shady offered me so that's a good fallback. And on Saturday, the bees play and after there are fireworks so I was thinking of that for everybody... but if there is a bbq, I'd doi that fo shi
Colby Condie
I might be able to. Depending on when other large events in my life might occur this week..
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom
Somethin big is going to happen.
Colby Condie
The plan is this week. Hopefully.
Merit Egan
Colb, the party would serve as a nice distraction. She wouldn't expect it the same day as a bday party
then it would provide a great post party
Colby Condie
Very true. I would probably do it in the morning then we can have a celebratory lunch then Kelli's party in the afternoon and evening
zach fackrell
Cool man! That's big news.
Let me know for sure if you need my help with anything
Colby Condie
Definitely.
Brayden Haws
Colby's baby all grown up
Colby Condie
Colbinski's baby is now becoming colbinski's father
Tyson Amundsen
My question is how is it 'hopefully' this weekend?
zach fackrell
His ring hasn't arrived yet
Colby Condie
Precisely Zach
Tyson Amundsen
I'll go beat their A right here, right now. Hows that for a gosh dang reference?
Colby Condie
Haha teez is red hot
Jeff Knudsen
I am a little behind on this convo but let me know what's going down.  Also, if you all didn't know, Rueben gets home this Thursday and there may be a gathering gathering in his behalf
Colby Condie
Yes are we all invited to go to his house on Thursday night then?
Rubinsky the elder
zach fackrell

hahahahahahahhahahahaha
Colby Condie

Merit Egan
haha nice. I would go to Jared's on Thursday.
zach fackrell
that was my way of saying id be there
Alex Crawford
two years goes by fast.
Brayden Haws
I'll be there, got work off just for him
Bryan Samuelson
Mertdog, what time frame were you thinking on Saturday? I'm busy til 1 and have stake conference at 7, but I would love to come
Also, may Colb's hammer be mighty
Also, I have good intel that Jared gets released at 9:15 on Thursday and we are welcome over after that
Colby Condie
Ayoo Rubinsky. I'll be there no doubt
Merit Egan
We're thinking Saturday evening would be a good time for a bbq.
Tyson Amundsen
Weather report?
Merit Egan
Great weather
Bryan Samuelson
Clear skies, high probability of fun
Colby Condie
75 degrees with no chance of not having a great time
Merit Egan
Facebook messaging an invite. I also propose murderer in the dark after the bbq.
Colby Condie
Yes merit. Yes
Brayden Haws
Shiz we won't be there, but we'll wish we were that's for damn sure
Tyson Amundsen
That's feef weather
Brayden Haws
#bootweather
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes
Merit Egan
Oh, some feef should definitely be on the schedule
Merit Egan


Tyson Amundsen
Thank you for that blessing merit
Who can give me a broad summary of the playoffs up to this point
Bryan Samuelson
First off, almost all the games have been super close. Very fun to watch. Also, lower seeds are doing quite well. Hawks are an 8-seed, up 3-1 on the pacers
Colby Condie
Pacers are down 3-2 and have been playing poorly. Heat swept bobcats. Clippers warriors series is a dandy. Spurs mavs are playing right now and it's a great game. Bulls are facing elimination game. Damian Lillard is the man. OKC is fighting back to win their series
Bryan Samuelson
*3-2, thank you Colb
Colby Condie
Yeah there have been tons of overtime games
Tuesday, April 29, 2014 12:28 PM
Tyson Amundsen


Bryan Samuelson
What the deuce?
Tyson Amundsen
http://www.thebunyion.com/2014/04/28/lds-church-begins-new-not-even-once-anti-beard-campaign/
haha
Brayden Haws
Donald sterling got lifetime ban from nba, and Adam silver is going to try to force him to sell
The clippers
Haha Teezr great pics also
Bryan Samuelson
That's super funny Tys
Colby Condie
Yeah haws I saw that. Goodbye Donald. He's the worst owner. Aside from his comments recently, he's been voted one of the worst owners
Funny Teezr
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
On that topic, I initially thought that was the most appropriate punishment. I'm beginning to question that. How old is he?
Brayden Haws
He's in his 80'd
80's
Edward Ekstrom
There should be no punishment
Brayden Haws
I think it's definitely right, there's no room for that kind of thinking in any sports league or any business
Edward Ekstrom
He's just a senile old man
Tyson Amundsen
Stuff like this happens in soccer in Europe a lot. A guy in his 30's just got a lifetime ban. Say he actually repents the act and realizes he was way out of line. Thirty years later he still has to bear that. At some point, he should be allowed back
Able to be allowed back. How do you judge when that time is? That's the hard part
I'm fine with a big fine and potentially forced out
When I think about that guy in Europe, I wonder the lifetime ban
Brayden Haws
I like the ban because I doubt sterling changes, he's had repeated racist statements. And no player is ever going to want to play for him
Tyson Amundsen
Personally I doubt he will either. It's very much generational. But in general, I don't like it
Same with Pete rose
Colby Condie
He has a lifetime ban from the Clippers organization. So potentially he could work with another franchise... But I doubt anyone wants him
Tyson Amundsen
I understood it as lifetime from the NBA
Brayden Haws
So did I, I must have read it wrong
Edward Ekstrom
We're going to be put in prison for not marrying gays I'm our temples when we're his age
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think you're wrong Eddy
Also colby it is from the NBA and the clippers
Colby Condie
Donald Sterling receives lifetime ban http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/10857580/donald-sterling-los-angeles-clippers-owner-receives-life-ban-nba?ex_cid=null
Maybe I'm reading it wrong. I understood the NBA is banning him from the clippers along with a 2.5 million dollar fine
Tyson Amundsen
It's the NBA
I'm listening to the press conference
Brayden Haws
Yeah nba, it says he's banned from attending any nba games or meetings and will essentially be forced to sell
The team
There a clause that allows the board of governors to force him out as owner
Tyson Amundsen
Notice there is no outrage that he is married yet attends the game with a girlfriend
Brayden Haws
There was a lot of talk on it about espn this week. But really the league can't really make that an issue I feel
Tyson Amundsen
I haven't heard any. And it absolutely should be an issue
Brayden Haws
It was on PTI and first take this week more than once
Essentially this guy is a huge dirt bag that has been a nuisance for years but this finally tipped the scales to get rid of him
Tyson Amundsen
Who watches tv anyways Haws #Twitterati
Edward Ekstrom
So where are the rules defined?
Like where does it say you can commit adultery but you can't be a racist?
Does the nba have a rulebook
Tyson Amundsen
Madrid just scored on Bayern!!!
Edward Ekstrom
For banning people?
Tyson Amundsen
There is an NBA constitution
I gather
Bryan come watch champs league
Madrid again!!
Bayern needs four goals in 60 minutes to advance
Brayden Haws
Yeah there is laws and a board of governors. I think the line is basically how his views reflect on society and the league if they allow him to continue making them. So basically society sees racism as not allowable but someone who is getting divorced dating another woman is fine by today's societal standards
Tyson Amundsen
Buckle up
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it. If that's the case, that makes sense.
Tyson Amundsen
Madrid 3!!! Holy shiz
Bryan Samuelson
Unreal
Tyson Amundsen
They are unbelievable on the counter
Colby Condie
Did you guys hear that Paul George's house got robbed during the Pacers playoff game last night? Someone stole $15,000 worth of jewelry and shoes
And they stole his NBA all-star ring too

Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Tyson you just hate Colby's ideas

Tyson Amundsen

Bryan Samuelson
Game 6, Blazers up 3-2 on the rockets. Rockets up 2 with 0.9 seconds, Damian Lillard hits a 3 to win the series
Unreal
Colby Condie

Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Busy peeps
Edward Ekstrom
7 tonight right mrt?
Merit Egan
Yes sir. Followed by an intense game of body body body led by Jeff.
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, will you be bringing a special lady?
Tyson Amundsen
I had a dollar on Uncle Sigh for the Kentucky Derby. He led for 3/4ths of it
Daft
I love horse racing
Colby Condie

Anyone else find this funny/strange/almost racist?
Merit Egan
That can't be real
Colby Condie
It really is merit
Edward Ekstrom
What is that magazine
Merit Egan
CST is over!
Edward Ekstrom
Almost there
Saturday, May 3, 2014 11:01 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Annie has work at 6am, sadly we had to miss body body body
Sunday, May 4, 2014 2:16 AM
Merit Egan
It was an epic night of body body body
John Sherwood
Finally I was granted the privilege to be the murderer. No longer slouching in fear
Merit Egan
I'm sad I spoiled you murdering spree by utilizing the alternate light strategy
John Sherwood
A strategy we'll have to determine if legal or not
Colby Condie
It was one of the best body body games yet
John Sherwood
Is tyson still our friend?
Colby Condie
Ya Tyson. Are you mad at us?
John Sherwood
Even just a courtesy text/vox to tell us you can't make it?
Sunday, May 4, 2014 9:11 AM
Tyson Amundsen
Guys I'm here. Alas, I thought I had indicated my absence You guys went hard, I'm proud of that
Edward Ekstrom
The real question is, where was Jared?
Colby Condie
Yeah is Jared alive?
Does he have a phone or anything?
Edward Ekstrom
Those questions are equivalent
zach fackrell
What happened in body body last night?
What was the alternate light source?
Colby Condie
Body body is one of the top 5 funnest house games. And Zach there was a point in the night when the murderer was killing people and then blocking the light source so people would get killed when they tried to turn on the light. Another switch was used at the other end of the room
Thus "alternate light source"
zach fackrell
Dang sounds like a good round. I was surprised that strategy didn't happen the first night we played.
Merit Egan
It was certain suicide by the murderer, but he slayed many a people in the process
Sunday, May 4, 2014 4:38 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Bryan, where was Sarah last night?
Bryan Samuelson
She had to babysit
Sunday, May 4, 2014 9:42 PM
Edward Ekstrom
What is y'alls stance on common core?
Colby Condie
I don't know much about that. What is it?
Edward Ekstrom
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative
Education used to be primarily controlled by states.
Colby Condie
So basically it's the federal gov't trying to control what is taught in schools?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
And how it is taught
Colby Condie
I always say the less power national government has is best
Edward Ekstrom
Al, let's hear your input.
zach fackrell
That's true Colby.
You do always say that
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not entirely sure. I've seen both sides. My initial thoughts are its unnecessary. However my cousin is a teacher that uses it and she sees some pluses
Edward Ekstrom
Also, they teach about gay sex
And you can't take your kids out of school during that week
even for religious purposes.
Colby Condie
I feel like that is defying the church and state clause
Tyson Amundsen
I hadn't heard that. It obviously seems inappropriate to not give the option to leave. I feel somehow there would be a way out
Edward Ekstrom
I bet there is, but still
Why can they teach about gayness and not about God?
I coin that phrase by the way.
Tyson Amundsen
What I know about it is that the idea seems to be to teach critical thinking. Like explaining the reasons why dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
Brayden Haws
I've talked to Tyson a lot about the common core and from reading more about it seems that a lot of the issues with it don't come from the core itself but rather from the text books schools buy to teach it. Basically the books that claim to teach the core are way complicated and not well written. There was an article from teachers who loved the core and it was due to having easy to understand texts for the students
Alex Crawford
The founding fathers left education to the states and we all know they were inspired men. I don't like it. Plus I feel Utah is capable of a higher standard than most states anyway and we should be better than what the Feds want.
Tyson Amundsen
I agree with Alex. Politically there should be no department of education if we go by the constitution. It sounds radical at first, but its really an example of administrative overreach
That's the way I see it
The core could work, but I still don't know I'm in favor. If teachers support it I'm more likely to agree
Alex Crawford
Looking further though it doesn't appear that this is funded by the Feds but a coalition of states trying to up the standards. I am all for making high school harder though. Megan and I both think that of high school was more difficult than a diploma would be worth something and everyone wouldn't feel they needed further college to have a competitive skillset in life.
Tyson Amundsen
State coalition? Interesying
Alex Crawford
Let's reserve higher education for the people who will make the most of it and give everyone else a worthwhile public K-12 education.
From wiki....As part of this education reform movement, the nation’s governors and corporate leaders founded Achieve, Inc. in 1996 as a bipartisan organization to raise academic standards and graduation requirements, improve assessments, and strengthen accountability in all 50 states.[3
Edward Ekstrom
Whatever the case, we should all vote Utah out of it when we get the chance.
Then we can take the good out of it but not be forced into anything retarded.
I'm disdained al hasn't chimed in with the liberal side..
Colby Condie
agreed.
Edward Ekstrom
Disappointed*
Tyson Amundsen
I still question that hay sex part. I understood the core to be about basic math and studded like that, not sex ed
Monday, May 5, 2014 11:17 AM
Edward Ekstrom
It's everything
Jeff Knudsen
I say we all run for some sort of office.  I'd be privileged to run alongside such fine gentlemen!
Merit Egan
I'll be the chef
#firstpick
Jeff Knudsen
#hawsforsecretservice #voteyes
Brayden Haws
I support Jeff in his nomination
Tyson Amundsen
I'll run for surgeon general
I will outlaw summer school as bad to the overall health of society
Merit Egan
Jeff can be the accountant. Like Chris Treagor on Parks and Rec. Jeff would fit that role perfectly

Tyson Amundsen
Zions employees- the zions on 4th south and 7th east is shaped weird. Like a bundt cake. Do you have a better comparison
John Sherwood
Nope I actually call it the birthday cake. The management at that branch is crazy. Leo and Yvonne. Use your imagination
Merit Egan
He just walks around every day saying, my name is Leo, what are ya gonna do about it (in a boston accent of course)
Edward Ekstrom
They chase each other sound the bundt cake all day but never find each other because they run in a circle.
Monday, May 5, 2014 10:41 PM
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Haha
Gr8 GIF indeed
zach fackrell

We should all go camping soon. Guys for reals
Colby Condie
Agreed
And I'll place a request to do a camping over nighter for my bachelor party
Merit Egan


Colby Condie

John Sherwood
Ya I'll camp Zach. I want to camp
Merit Egan
Haha zoolander gif. the first I've ever seen.
Bryan Samuelson
I'll camp Zach. I will camp
Colby Condie
I fully commit to camping
zach fackrell
Let it be written!
zach fackrell
Goodnight you princes of Maine. You kings of New England
Tuesday, May 6, 2014 8:11 AM
Brayden Haws
I love camping, you know I love it
Al will too
Edward Ekstrom
I'll camp, camping rocks
Tuesday, May 6, 2014 1:25 PM
Bryan Samuelson
Guys Nick Rimando's wife just came into my store to print off her itinerary for Brazil
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha booueh I hope you ay least said you were a fan. And we love Nick. And he is the greatest keeper ever.
Colby Condie
Jazz should hire mark Jackson
Brayden Haws
Shiiiiiii. Did you guys see that perishing is pushing for the song to be changed? Fuh utah I'm never coming back
Tyson Amundsen
Is he? Where are you seeing that
Brayden Haws
Espn
http://m.espn.go.com/ncf/story?storyId=10890356&src=desktop&ex_cid=espnapi_internal
I guess pushing is bad word choice but he seems to be for it
Bryan Samuelson
What an idiot. He just wants to look good
Merit Egan
Mark Jackson is the worst
Tyson Amundsen
Nick Rimando is the best
Brayden Haws
Tyson: Brayden Haws liked your comment
John Sherwood
Jesus is the Christ
Brayden Haws
John: Brayden Haws liked and testified of your comment
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
If the song gets changed, I'm glad I am not a University of Utah student right now.
If not, I will forever regret graduating from BYU
Merit Egan
Oh it's getting changed. You'll be able to tell your children you had nothing to do with it.
Brayden Haws
http://www.blocku.com/2013/3/31/4169138/utah-to-drop-nickname-utes-in-total-brand-overhaul
I hate utah now
This isn't real but it's what's happening to us
Edward Ekstrom
Haha

#greenpooh
Merit Egan
pooh is the worst way to say that word. Of all the options: Pooh, poop, crap, dump, shi*...
Pooh just doesn't end. It just has a breathy finish. Pooohhhhhhh.
Tyson Amundsen
Sick
Merit Egan
Happy Birthday. #fifapup
Tyson Amundsen
I'd guess its a gerbil
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Yup. Big one, too. Nearly 1 kilo
Colby Condie
If there's one thing Teezr knows, it's animals
Gerbils, lambs, chickens
Edward Ekstrom
Did you really get that?
Edward Ekstrom
I hate summer school..
Merit Egan
It'll be ready in 6 weeks
Tyson Amundsen
Takes about that long to watch Ben-Hur. Hour and a half down, two hours to go
Wednesday, May 7, 2014 9:11 AM
Edward Ekstrom
That's so sweet merit. Are boxers expensive?
Merit Egan
usually they are 500-600, but this one is 375.
And I bought it with ISIS so it was only like $2
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
If the deal were free I'd get one..
Merit Egan
It's time for Boozer to mentor his protoge
Edward Ekstrom
What are you guys going to do with it when you're both at work?
Merit Egan
So we are moving to my parents house for a bit to save for a house, so it will just follow the booze hound around the house.
Edward Ekstrom
Oh sweet!
That's an easy way to train it. Won't it be super sad when booz dies?
Merit Egan
Yeah it will train up real nice. I bet it will be very sad. We did the same thing with Boozer, and it was a transition when Boxer died.
Colby Condie
have you named it yet merit
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah I remember. I heard did can die of sadness when that happens. Dogs are awesome, most loyal things around.
Did=dogs
Merit Egan
I'm open to suggestions. Kelli has a list of a few names. She has Simon at the top of her list. I like Boris.
Dogs are the coolest. So loyal.
Edward Ekstrom
Name it rezoob.
Colby Condie
Brick, Brock, Brent, Jerry, Greg..
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom
Boozer backwords
Merit Egan
rezoob
Brick would be good
Edward Ekstrom
Or rexob
Our memo.
Like the dog we had for a few weeks
Or*
Merit Egan
I suggested Memo to kelli. She disapproved. I remember when you had Memo
sweet dog
John Sherwood
Got to be a B name I think. Traditional
Bryan Samuelson
Boler
Booner
Colby Condie
Buck. like uncle buck
Brayden Haws
Bogtrotter
Edward Ekstrom
Boomer
His body's boomin
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Brohan
John Sherwood

Edward Ekstrom
Riders of brohan
Beddy Bekstrom
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Bedword
Merit Egan
They had another baby boxer that looked just like ours that was a female. Someone get it!
Colby Condie
how much? same price?
Merit Egan
yes sir
Edward Ekstrom
If it was a girl you could name her Bathsheeba
Colby Condie
haha
Edward Ekstrom
I programmed for 12 hours yesterday. And in have about 10 hours worth today..
Merit Egan
shizzle. Is this work or school?
John Sherwood
Are they siblings? Or could they mate down the road? If they can mate, it'll be an investment and I'll get her
Edward Ekstrom
School. I took work off for summer term because it's intense.
Merit Egan
nice, then you are done in August?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup. Next term will be easy though so I'll be able to work again.
Brayden Haws

I built the whole paint program yesterday btw...
it is a hilarious flashback.
Colby Condie
Eddy I'm still trying to find that video of the Polish TV show intro
Hilar
Edward Ekstrom
I can ask dj
Bryan Samuelson
Have y'all heard about this? $44 for season tickets if the jazz win the lottery. That'd be sweet

http://www.nba.com/jazz/paythepick
Colby Condie
Yeah man I did see that. Crazy
Bryan Samuelson
Provocative idea
Brayden Haws
Me and kasey want to do it, we discussed it this morning
Edward Ekstrom
Do you have to risk it and sign up now or can you still do it after?
Merit Egan
it matches the pick, so if the jazz got the 3rd pick, it would be 3$ a ticket and cost you 123$
1st pick=44
2st pick=88
3rd pick 132
4th pick 176
5th pick 220
there is an 81% chance we are top 5
there is a 33% chance we get top 3
Bryan Samuelson
You do have to risk it though, right? That's what it seems like. Even $3 or $4 a ticket is pretty good
Merit Egan
yeah it would be a screaming deal. But you have to buy it now.
Edward Ekstrom
What if were 7
That would suck haha
Merit Egan
haha yeah, 7*44=308
308 vs 44
But your typical ticket for season tickets is $10 bucks, so even worst case scenario is still 30% off
Colby Condie
Are they upper bowl only?
Merit Egan
yeah, upper bowl baseline
Edward Ekstrom
Oh that's nice
How much are tickets if you just go to a game?
Merit Egan
for upper bowl they would be 15 probably
Edward Ekstrom
alex, why don't you have a picture still?
Tyson Amundsen
Unless you go to a weekday game merit. Then you scalp and go for $3
Or use stub hub. I went to a midweek clippers game one or two years ago for $5 or less
Nice thing about the staples center- all seats are padded
I was king of the top row. With Zach
John Sherwood
This is by far my best snapchat
Brayden Haws
It was good John, but also scary
John Sherwood
I agree. Flirting with danger
Edward Ekstrom
You should tell zion to get you a new name tag, it's all backward.
John Sherwood
I know. I have to set up a mirror contraption each day
Wednesday, May 7, 2014 6:41 PM

Colby Condie
Just yelling about how cool
It is
Talking about how he is putting the ingredients in and all
Merit Egan
What was that balloon?
zach fackrell
Hilarious vid.
Brayden Haws
Condom
zach fackrell
I think that was a ballon clowns use for ballon animals
Merit Egan
like one of the ones they turn into a puppy?
zach fackrell
Ya exactly then give them to children to make them happy
Merit Egan
It's cool that it comes in that little package. That must be expensive for clowns.
zach fackrell
They usually get them for free. That's why clowns are always so happy
And so willing to share
Colby Condie
Just a crazy Italian
Yeah a condom
Typically used for sexual activity
Merit Egan
woah, colb, dial it back
just cause you are getting married...
zach fackrell
Ya man wtf
Clearly mentos and coke isn't sexual at all. So why would he use a condom???
It's basic logic.
Merit Egan
yeah, but kids love mentos, so he would use clown balloons
zach fackrell
Bingo. Merits got it
Brayden Haws
It's a very sexual act
He probably got confused and now his wife is pregnant
zach fackrell
What? How do you get pregnant from diet coke?
Merit Egan
yeah, if you can get pregnant from cola, i better get checked
zach fackrell

Brayden Haws
I meant he used the condom on the soda and the balloon on her
Colby Condie
Condoms, balloons what's the difference.
Alex Crawford
On a more serious note, what is the Nutella for?
Tyson Amundsen
Haws and his stupid class
Colby Condie
Exactly
Haws do you still have that book? Get rid of it
It's cursing us
Thursday, May 8, 2014 10:54 PM
Merit Egan

zach fackrell
This weekend. I'm going to Vegas tomorrow. Friends. Come to Vegas. I have to film a wedding reception/ temple exit on Saturday. Come with me
Brayden Haws
I think the wendover bus is like 15 bucks and you get a free dinner and 5 bucks of chips
John Sherwood

John Sherwood
I'd yell body body tonight if need be
A good bbq at gessels then a game in the dark teez?
Tyson Amundsen
It sounds great. I may stir something else up but if not I'm game #pun
Merit Egan
talmage suggested body body body at the church in the dark gym. Could be fun. no obstacles may make it less fun. I dunno.
Colby Condie
We could put a ton of chairs and basketballs and sharp objects on the gym floor. And play barefoot. That would make it interesting
zach fackrell
Come play in Vegas
John Sherwood
I play barefoot anyway.. and too many lights in Vegas. Too hard to sneak

Agreed
It was a good call
A great call must consist of 4 or more participants to qualify
Edward Ekstrom
John do you have xbox live? I'd be down for some halo but I would have to join remotely from provost via xbox live
Al, glad you're in town. We may have to come up tonight to hang out but is everyone going to Luke's wedding or something? We did not receive an invite
Merit Egan
I also did not receive an invite. I feel uninvited
Tyson Amundsen
For Luke's wedding and all weddings, receiving an invite is not a requirement to go. I hardly ever out my address in invite things anymore even if I plan on going. I'll just go
Merit Egan
I still feel uninvited
Tyson Amundsen
Well that's your choice then. Choose ye this day
But as for me and my house, there's not a wedding celebration in this valley I don't feel invited to
Colby Condie
Teezr the wedding crasher
Merit Egan
Well I don't feel the love
Tyson, will you hang out with me tonight after the wedding?
Merit Egan
Is this Jess Ringwood's papa? Just on my homework video.
Brayden Haws
Guys just checking in from Vegas, almost back to the land of milk and honey
I've missed you all
Alex Platis
Luke told me that a bunch of his invites got screwed up, so that may be the case.
zach fackrell
Haws come get lunch with me. I'm in vegas
Brayden Haws
We're pulling out right now, I'll have em leave me next to the highway, pick me up
Merit Egan
There once was a time when we'd have 6 or 7 call participants.
Brayden Haws
http://www.viralnova.com/weekly-chalkboard-art/
Colby Condie
Merit alas I was getting a haircut when you called
Also, is Jared Carter alive?
Tyson Amundsen
Haws that's weird. How do they know its a duo of seniors from a specific major I'd its anonymous? And the art is alslways being displayed in the same room? That art is way impressive, how is hat real. And why
Brayden Haws
Yeah idk who makes it, it's just looks awesome
And they had a sweet mark twain one, that's my life
Edward Ekstrom

Bryan Samuelson

Merit Egan
I'm sick and tired of getting effed over by these votes. Bsam I need you over here to take some votes
Bryan Samuelson
Mertdog I'm sorry to hear that. Is there no justice?
Merit Egan
No justice. The murderers are showing no mercy
Sunday, May 11, 2014 9:31 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Bsam, did Sarah come to your family movie night?
Bryan Samuelson

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Mulholland rounds the keeper for 4. 4-2 RSL
zach fackrell

Tyson you would've loved it

Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan

Alex Crawford

http://wimp.com/reeboknike/
For the Spanish speakers among us.
Bryan Samuelson

zach fackrell
Hahah son reebok o nike
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Monday, May 12, 2014 8:25 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, they are moving to Denver for his dental residency.
Merit Egan
sweet
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah it's closer than Kentucky that's for sure.
Unless you travel west the whole way. Then it's further
Merit Egan
how long is a dentist residency?
haha, travel west to denver.
Edward Ekstrom
He's doing pediatric dentistry so I think it's 2 years. Some are shorter some are longer I think.
Merit Egan
So I have this 2 credit class that lasts only a week, but it's every day from 8-11, and then a shiz ton of hw due before the next morning. This blows diaretic chunks.
Brayden Haws
Merit is that am or pm
?
Merit Egan
am
Merit Egan
teez, what do you think of the MLS tv deal?
Tyson Amundsen
Merit all I know is it was supposed to be a new and better deal with ESPN? Can anyone enlighten me with the deets?
Basically more tv is good. The league needs more money
It has solid fan bases and support, but real revenue is tv and advertising
From my understanding at least. I don't understand much, because the amount of money in baseball is baffling
Brayden Haws
Yeah it's supposed to be a large deal, espn 3 will now broadcast tons of MLS games. They're paying MLS more than nbc pays the epl
Merit Egan
I guess the old tv deal the mls had was like 27M, and this one is 90M.
zach fackrell
Hey guys who wants to come to Washington/ Alaska with me from May 27t-June 4th it's gonna be funnnnnnnn.

Skydiving in Washington was ranked #4 in the world.

And according to Bryan Samuelson Alaska ranks #1 in the world.
John Sherwood
Zach. I'm calling you at lunch. I may come
zach fackrell
Yessss!
John Sherwood
Would it be expensive? Do we have places to stay?
Tyson Amundsen
Those are good things for MLS. Also for Zach
zach fackrell
We're staying with joshes fam in Washington. Still looking for stuff in Alaska.
Bryan Samuelson
I can confirm Zach's claims about Alaska. Unfortunately I don't think I can come because of school and new job. Stupid fiscals
Colby Condie
This is tempting Zach
Actually wait what are the dates
zach fackrell
May 27-june4
Join me
John Sherwood
Ask it off colb. Today
zach fackrell
Mmmmyeweesssssd
Doit
John Sherwood
What are the dates of Washington and Alaska?
zach fackrell
Alaska May 28-31

John Sherwood

zach fackrell
Sounds grand
John Sherwood
How is there going to be a car up there?
zach fackrell
Me and josh are driving up the 27th.

Our flight to Alaska leaves the 28th at 9:30pm.

Joshes car stays in Seattle while we're in Anchorage.

Renting a truck in alask

Edward Ekstrom

zach fackrell
Yes john.
Yes eddy.
Tyson Amundsen
Meanwhile, President Pershing just emailed me. I'm sure its stock, thanking me for voicing my opinion on Utah man
But he's a weiner
Brayden Haws
Yeah I just got it too
I hate him
Alex Platis
I thought he was supposed to be a man of the people?
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not sure if there was something about him that gave you that idea. But I don't think I'd agree
Brayden Haws
Zach I'll go if you convince my wife
Also when is the first swim of the summer?
zach fackrell
Hopefully Memorial Day weekend.. If it's not snowing. But that's usually the weekend it's open.
I love summer
Jeff Knudsen
To add to the fiestas previously stated, there is a midnight 5k in st george over memorial day weekend.  $25 if you sign up before the 16th.  It would be fun if a bunch of us went, so chew on that and let me know if you want to come.
Merit Egan
I'm chewing, I'm chewing.... I'm not sure if I'll come back to this restaurant, but I'm open to the idea. I'll mull it over for a few days.
Colby Condie
Jeffsky I'll already be down that weeks for Whitley's wedding. I'm highly considering it. What night is it? Friday night?
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, Annie and I could probably come.  Would we stay at your cond?
Brayden Haws
I'll come if I don't have to run
Merit Egan
I also will be down there already. Sounds like we'll have to party.
Colby Condie
Serious merit? We should all do something
Like jump off a roof or sometning
Merit Egan
yes sir
are there any races we could run or anything?
Colby Condie
Yeah there's a 400 mile foot race from salt lake to st George. We could do that instead of drive
Tyson Amundsen
I'd do that, but I don't wanna do any 5k
Merit Egan
yeah, I'll never race Jeff again
Alex Crawford
Ill race with you Jeff! I bet I could talk Megan into going easily.
Tuesday, May 13, 2014 12:27 PM
Brayden Haws
Guys screw venmo you can now do payments to friends over google
Tyson Amundsen
Screw you Haws. You're not the victim here. That dang human sexuality
... and at first I thought you wrote "screw you guys"
Merit Egan
woah teez, throwing out wild accusations
Brayden Haws
Whoa Tyson, you just hate me now
Merit Egan
ok guys, I highly suggest a night of Feef. I am off work at 5 and would love to play anytime, anywhere
I'll play new feef, old feef, fake feef, real feef
Tyson Amundsen
13
I have fake feef at 750 Gardner village
Brayden Haws
Merit what about tomo? Guys night dinner and feef
Merit Egan
I could tomorrow. I have school until 7:45, but could after. I could do both nights
John Sherwood
I fake feefed yesterday. I'll do it again
Merit Egan
would anyone else be in for tonight, and then we'll reconvene tomorrow?
Brayden Haws
I can after 10
Edward Ekstrom
I'm to sick
too*
Colby Condie
I work til 5 then teach Italian from 6-7:30..
Tyson Amundsen
http://touch.latimes.com/#section/1780/article/p2p-80188631/
For you Haws, and others interested. Headline "Obamacare extends medical coverage and increases costs in LA"
Lawmakers just figured it has already cost $1.2 billion more than expected, and it sounds like doctors will be hoses
hosed
Brayden Haws
Thanks Teezr, I'll give it a read
You're right doctors are gonna get hosed or stop seeing patients that have that coverage
Tyson Amundsen
So looks like I prob don't wanna live in Cali. But I fear it will be like that everywhere eventually. Could be big issue for me, especially if I choose primary care. Which is as likely as anything at this point
Brayden Haws
Yeah I'm sure it will be big time anywhere. We already don't take exchange enrolled plans here cause they don't pay enough
The ACA didn't really provide access to health care for more people, it provided access to coverage which are not the same thing
Tuesday, May 13, 2014 7:04 PM
Tyson Amundsen

Haws they sent me your mail
Brayden Haws
Get me that free book
Let's buy then for John and colby
#premarital
Tyson Amundsen
Dood great idea. That'll come out to like $6 each and we can count it as a wedding gift
Brayden Haws
Exactly
Two birds with one stone
Two dicks with one book
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha
Bryan admit its funny!
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, mr. Olivander from hp reminds me of an old man version of you.
Wednesday, May 14, 2014 10:17 AM
Merit Egan
We should start a twitter conversation about a fake Jazz coach thing.
Like one of us saw Tom Izzo driving downtown, then begin speculating
Brayden Haws
Tom izzo is too good, it should be someone horrible
Vinny del negro
Merit Egan
haha Vinny
Tyson Amundsen
Vinny Testaverde
Merit Egan
Biakabtuka
Tyson Amundsen
Haha oh man
Merit Egan
Larry Frank, the nets coach from a few years ago. is that his name?
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's the guy
He still works for the nets as a report writer; he got demoted by kidd
Merit Egan
interesting. So i guess he wouldn't be out here right now
Brayden Haws
He could be
Report writer to head coach
That's big time
Wednesday, May 14, 2014 2:38 PM
Tyson Amundsen
I'd like to see a gif or meme about home teaching
John Sherwood
Anyone want to play tennis today?

Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Nickel mania
Merit Egan
Talmage wants us to come play some weird game in the dark too
John Sherwood
I like that. Or church games. I'd play a game in the dark too
Merit Egan
I'd be open to the following:
1. Dark Game
2. Church Games
3. Feef Games
4. N. Mania
5. Cool Movie
6. Any idea that Jeff has
7. Anything that gets Tyson to come

No particular order
Brayden Haws
I second all of merits ideas
Colby Condie
Especially 7
Brayden Haws
I never even played body body yet
zach fackrell
Yes to all the above
Merit Egan
What a treat it would be to be the first person to slice Haws' throat
John Sherwood
Oh the joy. Merit, what of tyson came too?? Whoa.
Brayden Haws
I don't wanna die
Merit Egan
Tyson is very good at slicing the throats of baby lambs, he is sure to be a fantastic murderer
Colby Condie
Haws we all die many times. And we all kill many people
Merit Egan
Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard the fear that occurs during this game
Colby Condie
Exactly
Once upon a time, there was a place where it never rained. The end!

Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen
So I sense we prefer movie to nickelmania? Vote
Merit Egan
I'd ultimately life to do something earlier rather than later. Went to bed at 2 and got up at 7. #tired
Tyson Amundsen
Also Brighton soccer didn't make the state quarterfinals. Legitimately, I'm not sure that has happened in our lifetimes
Merit I concur, I have 645 am work tomo. Do we movie or do we nickel? #PatriarchalPriviledge

Colby's song!!!!!
Da na na an na na naaaa
Someone owes me a million $$
John Sherwood
Find of the year! Minni owes it to you
Merit Egan
I wish to hear Colby's confirmation. If that is not it, then the song surely does not exist, because they would be copying this song exactly.
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha Zach you have done the Impossible. I hereby award you the nobel peace prize
Colby Condie
I need to listen to it on my break. Confirmation pending
John Sherwood
All right boys, I'm free for the morning and afternoon. Sure anyone else have the day off and care to: hike, golf, tennis, spike ball, play the SIMS?
Tyson Amundsen
I can't, I'm Mormon
In reality I'm busy unfortunately
Colby Condie
IT IS THE SONG!! History is made.
Merit Egan
This is a joyous day. Although I am also kind of sad that this song has been found. It provided several humorous moments, such as the other night during body body.
Colby Condie
Very true very true. I'll have to find another song and keep it going
zach fackrell
Yes!! Colby I knew you weren't crazy haha the joy I felt when I found that song will never be matched
Colby Condie
Zach also deserves an award at the Xcerpt banquet. Pending approval from merit of course
Merit Egan
of course, of course.  That is, if we ever have a banquet. Buffalo Wild Wings called last time and was pissed that we cancelled our reservation.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
John Sherwood

John Sherwood
2 under 34. My best round
Colby Condie
Atta boy Jeezle. Any bogies?
John Sherwood
One bogey
Alex Crawford
John that's heroic. I am awestruck.
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
John you can qualify for the US Open if you keep playing like that.
Tyson Amundsen

Weirdest thing I read today
Edward Ekstrom
No way...
Are their kids handicapped?
Brayden Haws
If they had kids I would assume so, either way that's jacked
Tyson Amundsen
Juan, I like Claire Hunter. I don't know chloe well, but zach went on a half date with her once
Tuesday, May 20, 2014 7:28 AM
John Sherwood
Claire is awesome. Chloe is awesome
John Sherwood
Do any of you fellows want to live with me for 2 months? It'd be 250 for everything... internet cable utilities washer dryer. I'm moving into the basement apartment that ju and I will live in. 13th and 13th. Food for thought. Move in first week of June
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws

John Sherwood
Eddy let's make it a full house. What do you say
Merit Egan
feefster beefsters on top of feefster beefsters

Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Likewise I work
Work sucks, summer rules
Tyson Amundsen
Likewise I Haws
John Sherwood
Let's do all these fun things this weekend. Swim tennis rio park
Brayden Haws
I'd do that
John I got a new mitt, we gotta throw it around
John Sherwood
Oh heck ya. I'm always down for toss
Brayden Haws
Last night I covered it in shaving cream and cooked it in the oven
Now it needs some good catches
John Sherwood
Very wise. Break it in. I slept on mine for a month
Tyson Amundsen
Shaving cream? Is that a traditional method or pure innovation
Brayden Haws
Traditional
Tyson Amundsen
What are the properties of shaving cream that are desirable there
Colby Condie
I use an oil for my mitts. Then place a baseball inside and duck tape it really tight. Let it sit each night
But there's no real substitute for just daily use and playing catch
Brayden Haws
Shaving cream has lanolin oil which in theory helps to soften the leather and keep it moist while you beat the shiz out of it
I Remember in little league my dad ran my glove over with his car to break it on
In
Colby Condie
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Try putting it in the toilet and flushing multiple times. Make that leather real soft and supple
Jared Carter
Tysons right but only when you wipe it off with Scott's Angel soft after.
zach fackrell
Scatterball tonight at 9:00 - my church we've got a big group coming already. 15 ish
Bring lanolin oil
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, I've got my mit in my car. I'll play catch right here right now.
Brayden Haws
That's a gosh dang good reference eddy
Tyson Amundsen
I need a new mitt. Where can I get one?
Merit Egan
amazon.com
they have everything
Tyson Amundsen
I scored a $25 gift certificate to academy sports. What do they have?
Brayden Haws
Tyson go to big 5 Stevie works there, that little weirdo can hook you up
Colby Condie
academy sports has a great selection tyson. if you're referring to the one by Home Depot/fort union area
I recommend the Rawlings gold glove. Best glove for your buck. The cheapest one will suffice
Alex Crawford
Sorry to step up to bat in the 9th inning but I just listened to Colby's song. Colby, that song is weird. All of my searching was for that!?
Tyson Amundsen
Alex, I'll take this moment to say that you need to frequent the Google vox more often. Your attendance is very low
Alex Crawford
And Tyson the VERY best way to break in your gloves is to catch balls shot from my homemade cannon.
Tyson Amundsen
Colb, good advice
Alex Crawford
My attendance has been low because I've been working 14 hour days and the. Coming home and fixing up the bike I just bought. No time to vox.
And a warm welcome to Jared! Sorry to have missed your homecoming but due to my in frequenting the vox I was unawares. My apologies. Good to have you back.
Colby Condie
hahaha crawdad
Brayden Haws
Colby that's the very glove I got, cost like 38 on sale
Jeff Knudsen
can someone tell me what's happening with the lottery.  I don't have cable
Merit Egan
Jazz got 5
So gay
Jeff Knudsen
bushhhhh
Merit Egan
Cleveland jumped
Bryan Samuelson
Freakin Cleveland
Jeff Knudsen
wait so who is 1-5
Brayden Haws
They don't deserve it
They've drafted horribly with all the picks they've gotten as of late
Merit Egan
Top 3 haven't been announced, but it's cleveland, 76ers and bucks in some order.
Jeff Knudsen
dang so cleveland will have irving, that new big guy they drafted, then either wiggins, parker, or ediim or however you spell it?
Bryan Samuelson
They'll still suck
Merit Egan
They got 1 for the 3rd time in 4 years. This is a joke.
Jeff Knudsen
Lame
Brayden Haws
Wtf? That can't be real
They're probably gonna draft Aaron craft or something dumb again
John Sherwood
They just want to see cleveland good so lebron can battke then in the playoffs. Weenie
Merit Egan
Hopefully they draft Randle or someone unexpected with the top pick.

Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie
Teez how are the lambs
Brayden Haws
Still up but about to go to sleep. Just saw that the odds of the cavs getting the top pick 3 out of 4 years was .046%
zach fackrell
I've got one word for that:

Hungout
Bryan Samuelson
This pleases me
John Sherwood
Me too. Ju and I really like her. Not like like
John Sherwood
Tennis tonight or something active? Sonnis? Spikeball?
Brayden Haws
This all sound fun
Zach lets go for a night swim
zach fackrell
Pool is being heated for the weekend. I'm not sure how warm it is for tonight. But I'll check
And yes I'm in for games and active stuff tonight
John Sherwood
Tennis? And then snowcone after??????
zach fackrell
Tennis.
Thomas works at rio again tonight haha
Tyson Amundsen
I will be able to party post dinner time I think. Tennis and slack
Interesting point- does anyone here know their blood type? I don't know mine but I wish I did
Brayden Haws
I believe mine is A- but I can't remember that for sure
But if you donate blood Teezr they'll tell you
Merit Egan
I sir, am O-

Colby Condie
If I remember correct, type O is the kind that can't be donated. Or maybe it's the opposite and can be donated to people of all types
Merit Egan
O- is the universal donor. I'm in high demand.
#blessed
Colby Condie
That's right
Brayden Haws
Merit, Collin is as well, he goes to give blood all the time
They love him
John Sherwood
But if you're in trouble, you can only receive O-... double edged sword
Jared Carter
You are also from region Lewis and Clark. Felicidades.
zach fackrell
That card is for "merit d ega"
I don't know him
Colby Condie
Haha Jared
Merit Egan
Tis better to give than to receive.
Brayden Haws
Merit that's why you're the patriarch
Tyson Amundsen
Haws you know I can't/don't donate blood
But I do want one of those patriarchal blood cards. Perhaps I am also of the Lewis and Clark lineage
Merits blood type is a good metaphor for his life. Called to serve, just like Haws said
John Sherwood
Merit 2:31- and it came to pass, merit brought mortal life to his brethren but even more to eternal life. The land rejoiced
Whose in for tennis?
zach fackrell
<----this guy
Colby Condie
We're going to look at an apartment at 6:30 tonight then we have another appt at 8:30
zach fackrell
What time is tennis/slackline time?

John Sherwood

Bryan Samuelson

John Sherwood
Willow creek it is. One hour
Snow cones after
zach fackrell
Deal
Tyson Amundsen
I will likely be slightly later than that. But I like tennis. And slack
Stephen Hawking had Lou gehrig's disease
I didnt know that's what it did. You lose control of your motor neurons, trapped inside your own body
Kinda like... inception? Alice in wonderland? I'm struggling to draw the right parallel
Brayden Haws
We could be late arrivals
John Sherwood
En route right now
Snag a court if you can z
zach fackrell
Everyone is coming late. That's fine. I'll go check out the court selection. I just ate. See you guys there
Tyson Amundsen
Hey Bryan

Bryan you just stared at me for 30 seconds and said nothing
Wtf
Bryan Samuelson
Wha? I just arrived
Tyson Amundsen
The Google vox, not real life. You know
zach fackrell
Hahah Bryan is here with John and Jules. Kim is coming too.
Get over here
Tyson Amundsen
That makes five. But I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't caaaaaaare #pork&beans #weezer
Tyson Amundsen
And hell could freeze over Haws
Brayden Haws
Whoa
Teezr with the swear
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think that counts
John Sherwood
I don't think so either
Either. Pronounced `I`ther. Not Eether
Tyson Amundsen
But like I've always said: Not everything that can be counted counts
And not everything that counts can be counted
Edward Ekstrom
Words of wisdom.  How was tennis?
Tyson Amundsen
Great man. Me bryan john Julia Zach and Jackie Chan. Solid performances all around
Temple tomo with me and Bryan all who are interested. 10 a.m.

Haha it's a close one. Tooele is freakin far out west
It takes me almost the same amount of time to get to Provo and Tooele
Merit Egan
Who wishes to PARTAY tonight?
John Sherwood
I wish to... I don't know if we can though.
Brayden Haws
I want to but work is my boss this day
zach fackrell
I don't wish to. But I can
Merit Egan
I both wish to and can, but won't, unless I do.
Merit Egan
Colb you should do this at Zions in the bathroom.
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Holy shi* no pun intended, the US roster is absolutely shocking
HOW IS THERE NO LANDON
I can't accept that, and I've heard plenty of possible explanations why
And they all suck
That's the main talking point. There are other questionable decisions.
People have noted that because of the controversial picks we can't properly celebrate how cool it is that Kyle Beckerman and Nick Rimando are going
Which is awesome. Kyle and nick both thought their national team careers were dead when they were like 24. Now 6 or 8 years later they are in the world cup
Merit Egan
Lego movie at 7 at the sugar house dollar theater. See you there.
Tyson Amundsen
That's fifteen minutes. Can't do
zach fackrell
Xmen - 10:00 at thanksgiving point! See you there
Edward Ekstrom
Well come!
zach fackrell
Whaaaaaa???
Yesssss!!
Edward Ekstrom
There are two showings at 10. How do I know which one to get?
zach fackrell
It's in theater 4.

Alex Crawford
When you walk into an empty bathroom and all stalls are empty is it ethical to take the handicapped one? I always do it for the extra room. A part of me feels somewhat guilty though knowing that someone handicapped could walk in anytime and need to poo way bad. Opinions?
Colby Condie
Great question Crawdad. I, myself, always take the larger stall. Handicapped or not. I've never had an issue with anyone handicapped needing it while I'm in there.
Tyson Amundsen
We've discussed this as well. I used to always take the roomier handicap stall, but now I don't. Handicap toilets are two inches taller than the one in the smaller stall. It turnaround out the shorter toilet is proven to be more comfortable and ergonomic
turns
Merit Egan
Tyson, great point. I've never noticed the taller toilet, but it really has been shown that humans poop better when in more of a squat position. Thus, the higher the knees, the healthier the plop.
Bryan Samuelson
Merit's right
http://www.squattypotty.com/
Merit Egan
The people who made that tried over and over to get my brother Ladd to do a story of it on the news. He refused cause he didn't want to be the reporter who did a story on the squatty potty
Bryan Samuelson
Haha he's a smart man
Brayden Haws
Haha I was trying to convince my boss to buy one of those off groupon and put it in the doctors bathroom for April fools
But I agree the handicap is nice for the sense of space around you but the other has a more comfy toilet, I think either is fine to use cause I've never encountered a disabled person using that stall
Edward Ekstrom
I love pooping
No matter the position or stall
#staypositive
#blessedpooper
Colby Condie
I'll sacrifice the lower squat position for a larger operating area any day. And if you have to go way bad, then the degree of your squatting doesn't matter. It's only on the ones that require more effort where the lower position is beneficial
And I agree with Eezle
Tyson Amundsen
This reveals Colby's lack of elegance. By choosing the taller stall you do your body a coarse and unnecessary disservice. By choosing the bigger stall you feed your own vanity
Merit Egan
Indeed, Colby looks to satisfy his own wants, before looking at the needs of others. This is evident by his choosing of the large stall, leaving handicapped people with no options, and his choice to disservice his own body by choosing the taller toilet.
John Sherwood
So if I were disabled and needed the extra room... I'd be denied the colon comfort and luxury of a smaller toilet? Hmmm.. I see something very wrong here
Merit Egan
very true John. Our society is filled with inequality. Forget the whole gay marriage rights, let's start with handicapped bathroom equality!
Tyson Amundsen
I don't know society can accept that boldness merit
Edward Ekstrom
#freeHandicappedWillie
John Sherwood
Open your mind tyson. And your colon.
Edward Ekstrom
And your TB
Merit Egan
Let freedom flow like the salmon of poopistrano
Edward Ekstrom
Wait, leave that closed.
I hope one of us runs for office one day and Google reveals this hangout to the nation. That would be royally hilarious.
Merit Egan
They'd be like "wow, these guys really do focus on the rights of everyone."
Everyone would be elected to the following positions:
President: Tyson Amundsen (Because of his presidential video)
Secretary of Defense: Haws. He'd beat the shiz out of anyone
Tyson Amundsen
Would merit be an off the record advisor? Like a guy who secretly wields all the influence?
Edward Ekstrom
Head justice of the supreme court: merit for his patriarchal wisdom
Merit Egan
Edward will head up our R&D department, coding programs to make anyone who doesn't agree with us turn into a robot.
Tyson Amundsen
John Secretary of the Treasury
Edward Ekstrom
Federal reserve commissioner: Jeff
Merit Egan
Tyson will have a 1st lady, and also a 1st 2nd lady and a 1st 3rd lady.
Edward Ekstrom
Head of agriculture: Reuben
And Seth
We'll appoint Bryan to be the commissioner of the NBA and Colby of the MLB
Jared, did you know I got an motorcycle while you were gone?
But then I sold it for twice as much as I paid for it.
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha merit with the lol
Brayden Haws
"You point someone out, I'll kick their ah right here right now" that's my campaign speech
John Sherwood
Gr8 topic of conversation crawdad. I think we got a lot done and, in a roundabout way, answered your question
Alex Crawford
Haha yup. I think so. Just tuned in. Work is too busy to keep tabs all the time and my poop break was over. But I approve of all that has been said and I will weigh my options, colon health vs ability to open the door without running into the toilet, next time I take one.
Merit Egan
There's also the factor of toilet paper roll placement. Sometimes it is just too cramped.
Or too low to the floor
Bryan Samuelson
I just want to say thank you to all of you for making me chuckle and keeping morale up during my chemistry lecture
Edward Ekstrom
Three prisoners, A, B, and C, are locked in their cells. It is common knowledge that one of them is to be executed the next day and the others are to be pardoned. Only the Governor knows which one will be executed. Prisoner A asks the guard a favor: "Please ask the Governor who will be executed, and then take a message to one of my friends B or C to let him know that he will be pardoned in the morning." The Guard agrees, and comes back later and tells A that he gave the pardon message to B. What are A's chances of being executed, given this information? Show how you come to your answer mathematically. Failing that try running a little simulation.
Homework question for my artificial intelligence class.  Similar to the question from the movie 21.
Brayden Haws
Like those problems with the doors
Is that what's on 21?
Edward Ekstrom
the gameshow with a car behind one door and two goats behind the others
Brayden Haws
That's the one
Edward Ekstrom
you choose a door and the gameshow host opens one of the others and shows a goat and asks if you want to trade to the door you didn't choose
Merit Egan
yeah, doesn't it jump to 50%
Edward Ekstrom
Nope
Merit Egan
even though it seems like it would stay at 33%
Edward Ekstrom
It does stay at 33%
Merit Egan
But the other person rises to 50%?
Edward Ekstrom
Prisoner A's probability of being executed
the other persons rises to 66%
sucks to be him
but in the case of the car behind a door you want to switch
Brayden Haws
Prisoner c
It sucks to be him
Edward Ekstrom
because Prob(car is behind the other door) = .66
Yeah it does
Brayden Haws
What's this called eddy?
Bayes rule
Or baynes?
Something like that
Edward Ekstrom
Bayes
Brayden Haws
I remember from stats learning about that and how probabilities work in card and dice games
It was cool
Erstwhile, what are we doing tonight?
Edward Ekstrom
We are going to a movie I think.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnZ0Y4rvz6E
this is why you don't go to college.
Merit Egan
I saw the Lego Movie last night. Pretty stupid, but entertaining.
Edward Ekstrom
You're the special Merit.
Merit Egan
so are you Eddy. We all are!
I'm just glad they got the piece of resistance on the kragle
Brayden Haws
I hate Ben af fleck
Edward Ekstrom
Why?
Brayden Haws
I bet he's just like that in real life
He just seems like a doofus
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Sound reasoning.
Brayden Haws
Like he always plays that same kinda character cause I think that's just how he is
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know many movies with him.
What are his other movies?
Brayden Haws
The town
Which was good but he's was just like that
Daredevil
Stupid
That's all I know but it's good enought for me
The new batman
Edward Ekstrom
He's batman!  no way...
Merit Egan
I traditionally don't like Ben Afleck much either. I thought he was great in Argo
Edward Ekstrom
why didn't they keep christian bale
Merit Egan
#bsamcleanflicks

That was a great flick. I want a subscription to bin flicks

Her name is Bonnie
Thus Bon flicks
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom
I want a pirate aunt.
Merit Egan
What is a Pirate Aunt's favorite video to edit?

Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Brighton reunion
Matt Palmer. Tanner hen. Alex stuhff
Alex Crawford
Does Alex Stuhff still have the worlds largest pecks.
?
Brayden Haws
Not as big as they used to be but he's jacked
Tyson Amundsen
Shoot him with your blow dart gun
Alex Crawford
Haha that's a bad idea. He'll have roid rage and snap you like a twig.
Brayden Haws
Yeah he just squated like 500 lbs I'm bit about to mess with him
Alex Crawford
Are you at the gym ?
Brayden Haws
Yeah at the fieldhouse
Alex Crawford
Just drop a 100 lb dumbbell on his toe and then he will be incapacitated.
Tyson Amundsen
It's important that you strike first Haws
Brayden Haws
I have to kill in one blow
Merit Egan
Yes, you were merely adopted into the gym. Stuhff was born in the gym, molded by it.
zach fackrell
Hahaha
Awesome
Friday, May 23, 2014 4:44 PM

Edward Ekstrom
Is that what their legs really look like?
Midget legs?
Brayden Haws
Maybe I did it weird
Or maybe they look like that in the pic, but not in real life
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah those legs for sure do not look normal
Colby Condie

Work poop
Sunday, May 25, 2014 12:16 PM
Edward Ekstrom
Do you wear your scrubs around campus?
Also, what did y'all do last night?
Brayden Haws
He had better damn well not be wearing scrubs around campus
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
So sometimes I wear a shirt that says "apache Cassandra" it. How does that compare to wearing scrubs outside of the hospital/clinic?
On it*
A question for the vox so I can avoid gayness if at all possible.
Brayden Haws
I assume that's some kind of programming project
Edward Ekstrom
Correct, it's a database.
Brayden Haws
How does it look? I say it's fine, anyone can wear a shirt, wearing scrubs is about trying to show you are better than others
Same as wearing a name tag that says you work for the hospital, in reality they likely have a lane job but they want us to think they are better than us
Edward Ekstrom
Excellent. I assumed it wasn't gay but now I have no doubt that it is not.
Brayden Haws
If anything it shows how cool you are cause it actually represents what you do, whereas people wearing scrubs are trying to show off as being high powered surgeons and such but really they wipe people's butts
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
I wiped butts and refused to wear scrubs outside of the hospital.
Anyone wearing scrubs probably has poop on them
Brayden Haws
You're a true American merit
zach fackrell
I almost just hit Cameron houser with my car. He was just walking across highland
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
zach fackrell
Tank top. Tattoos. Tourette's..
Edward Ekstrom
Who?
zach fackrell
Tourette syndrome.

Edward Ekstrom
He's got tats?
John Sherwood
Cam houser is crazy. Tom houser is cool
Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Comin hot Zach
Brayden Haws
Guys calling all friends. Would anyone be interest in bbqing tonight? Kaseys parents are gone and have a huge grill so she's volunteered we can use it if people want to do so
Bryan Samuelson
I'm a solid maybe. Not a maybe that means no, a maybe that means maybe
Jared Carter
Dude I do love bbqs but I'm smoking some ribs right now in Logan.
Merit Egan
I'm also a solid maybe. Still in St george, getting ready to leave fairly soon... what time you thinking?
John Sherwood
Ju and I were eating at my parents... but we're in for festivities after
Colby Condie
I honestly feel I can do that haws. Going to lunch and a movie with Minni's family in like an hour but probably free after that
Tyson Amundsen
I'm a solid no but with a hearty thank you. And jared what are you doing in Logan? When you come home you don't go back
Brayden Haws
We're pretty flexible for times
What if we did it at 7? Who would attend? And want food? We'll get it all just don't wanna buy too much?
Brayden Haws
Guys
Hello
Guys
Colby Condie
Dude haws we would like to come

Depending on what we can get done
Merit Egan
It sounds like my family is putting something together. I'm out for tonight.
Tyson Amundsen
That's zero confirmed
Brayden Haws
Well now I hate myself
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Time to write your feelings #MeinKampf
Tyson Amundsen

Bryan Samuelson

John Sherwood
Oh ya.. I want to view
Bryan Samuelson
It's good man. I watched part 1 last night
Tyson Amundsen
Way to go Bryan! Solid performance from Charlton Heston. Great musical score. Top notch story telling
Tyson Amundsen
Juxtaposes the Hollywood of then vs. now
Tuesday, May 27, 2014 9:55 AM
John Sherwood
Watch party tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
I have indoor soccer at 7. Then I want to watch. If at my house probably miss a little bit or if recorded somewhere then all of it. I believe its at 8 on ESPN2
Bryan Samuelson
I wouldn't be able to be there until about 8:30 or 8:45, but I'd like to watch it
Colby Condie
I am actually going to a birthday dinner for Minni's brother tonight... No can make the game
Merit Egan
Yeah, I am also going to a birthday dinner for Minni's brother tonight.
Tyson Amundsen
Good thing I invited him over for pizza and the USA game tonight, we'll all be there
Tyson Amundsen
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-RuIsxGX4M
John Sherwood
How quickly your golf fate can change. Plus 8 after 7.
Brayden Haws
Is anyone off work tomo who would like to go hiking?
John Sherwood
I'll go
Tyson Amundsen
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.
Brayden Haws
Alright let's take a morning walkabout
Tyson Amundsen
#Cameron
Brayden Haws
Tyson what if we went to that lake that's above where we camped in big cottonwood loop, where jed yodeled all night?
Tyson Amundsen
Like the same trail? I don't remember a lake on that trail
Also I was just saying the Cameron quote cuz its funny...
But I could maybe be talked in
For later
Brayden Haws
Yeah it was like an hour past camp I'd say, it was in a huge meadow
You were quoting Cameron but also saying the desires of your sole
Tyson Amundsen
We have no pics of it. That doesn't mean its not there tho. We can consult a book
Definitely they are the desires of my heart
Brayden Haws
Oh it's there for sure we didn't stop there cause we had a long ways to go
Tyson Amundsen
Thing is for me to be fiscally hard working, which currently my days require (10 days to MCAT and applying) I have to work first and party after
I've found when I try to do fun first and work after I always struggle. Go figure, but I can't het my mind as focused
And I only mean that in my immediate past. I don't think fun always has to be after work
Brayden Haws
But soaking in the wilderness will refresh your mind and prepare it for the trials ahead
Tyson Amundsen
Haha soaking
Brayden Haws
Haha
John Sherwood
Let's do gobblers knob
Brayden Haws
John that would be fun, though I don't know that I can invest that much time tomo. But it's a must this summer
Along with timp night hike
But tomo I wanna go somewhere
Broad Forks Meadow
Tyson Amundsen
Mill B south was that one I think Haws, on the way to twin peaks
Mount Wannahakaloogie
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's the name of the meadow that's got all the beaver ponds and lake in it on the way to twin peaks
Haha nemo
Tyson Amundsen
I love having indoor in the evening. Sound reasoning for me to not shower all day
Wednesday, May 28, 2014 8:53 AM
Brayden Haws
Guys my phone has said I have had one notification in here for days why won't it go away?
Edward Ekstrom
That's happened on my iPhone before too.
Tyson Amundsen
Hmmm. I have a Droid incredible. Never had that problem #veteransavvy
Edward Ekstrom
Never on my android
Alex Platis
Haws that's been on mine too. I've been baffled.
Brayden Haws
I feel like it's because there was a video call and I missed it. Because in my google hangout it keeps asking me to join a video call but when I click it it just opens the hangout and the notification won't go away
Colby Condie
Maybe delete and reinstall the app
Might work
Merit Egan
call sam from holes. He can fix that.

Colby Condie
Haha
Brayden Haws
Guys can we discuss how holes is on abc family literally everyday
I think it's the only show they have
Colby Condie
It is??
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Bless you merit
Edward Ekstrom
Afternoon poo
Brayden Haws
The hangout is fixed!
Edward Ekstrom
How'd you fix it?
Brayden Haws
It fixed itself
Merit Egan
It's regenerative... just like the human body... impressive. I can't wait until phone screens heal themselves after a scratch.
Colby Condie
Did you get a scratch merit
Merit Egan
I did not, but there is always a fear.
Colby Condie
Always
They should make scratch and shatter resistant screens
Edward Ekstrom
Made of diamonds.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
The screen alone costs like $100,000
Tyson Amundsen
Crawdad knows about this stuff. Material science
Alex Crawford
There is a phone that heals scratches.
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-W66HINFLg#
It's probably just a thermoplastic that is right at its glass transition temperature so it will flow back to fill in the scratch. Kind of like how silly putty will fill the shape of the egg it comes in but doesn't run all over the table like a liquid.
Merit Egan
I would really only care if it healed the screen. That's the only place a scratch is very unfortunate
Tyson Amundsen
Merits right. But that's pretty interesting stuff
Alex Crawford
That's what screen protectors are for though right?
Merit Egan
It's definitely cool, it's just not an order winner for me. #marketingterm
But screen protectors add another 20 bucks to your phone, and they often start to look bad.
The ideal phone would require no case or screen protector, and would be waterproof. They are starting to hit these.
Tyson Amundsen
Why stop there merit? Once we have the ideal phone, we should create the perfect system #TRON
Merit Egan
I knew I could trust Tyson
Wednesday, May 28, 2014 7:06 PM

Happy birthday Jeffsky. Bonjour
Brayden Haws
Fun fact I just learned: in scrabble if you use all you tiles 3 turns in a row it is a hat trick
Edward Ekstrom
Is it worth like 5 million points?
Brayden Haws
It's just worth however many points you get, that's just what it's called
I was reading and article that was explaining all the sports that use the term hat trick
Bryan Samuelson
Haws man, that is a gem. I love sports, I love trivia, I love scrabble, I love terminology
Brayden Haws
You can also use it in poker if you eliminate 3 other players with one hand
Which is extremely rare/nearly impossible
Tyson Amundsen
That makes me love scrabble more

Colby Condie

Tyson graciously showed me this funny pic from a tweet
Brayden Haws
Haha 50 cents was the worst
Colby Condie
It really was. I don't get how you can be that bad.
Tyson Amundsen
Not bad from Stone Cold Steve Austin. But how bout Snoop Dogg? I would've thought he and 50 cent's pitches were mislabeled for each other
Edward Ekstrom
Haha the cookie monster was way off.
also, we should only elect presidents who can put it in or near the strike zone.  Obama sucks.
#limpWristPitcherPresident
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Merit is on a roll
Yeah Uchtdorf did the dodgers game I think last year
Mormon night
Merit Egan
I can't find a gif of that, only pictures.
Alex Crawford
Is 50 cent left handed? Cause his pitch sure was. And that gymnast does an impossible flip. That can't be real.
Tyson Amundsen
All I know is when I was in downtown LA in my mission, the missionaries in the area adjacent to mine were riding their bikes last a place where they were filming something with 50 cent. And the entourage wanted the missionaires to be on the video
Like ride their bikes in the background
The senior companion declined, bless his heart
Merit Egan
It's real, but somebody 1 upped her now
http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1742218-actress-throws-awesome-flip-first-pitch-in-korea

He was French tho. He may not have known what he was turning down
Brayden Haws
Wtf? I woulda done that in a heartbeat
Colby Condie
Haha those da** Koreans
And yeah I woulda been in 50 cent's video no doubt

Colby Condie
Hot dang
Edward Ekstrom
Did anyone watch the real game? Why'd we get smoked?
Tyson Amundsen
I saw the first half and we went down 1-0 on a penalty. It was a toss up if you ask me
I know they scored on a free kick for the next
And idk about the others. We weren't looking too bad when I saw but I need to see some highlights
Jared Carter

Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen
So to satisfy your desire you went in a date with Heber?
That doesn't compute
Edward Ekstrom
Everyone come to Provo and hang out in our yard. We're going to have a fire
Tyson Amundsen
Heber's a good guy. But I feel you should try to party with him during the week and leave the weekends free. I need a wingman Jared

Tyson Amundsen
Give me 6 months and I'll be there in the OT
And give me 10 months and I'll follow her proposal example
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, she snuck into his room and uncovered his feet then laid by them.
That is how you proposed in those days.
The woman had to do it.
Bryan Samuelson
That's how I've always planned to propose.
Brayden Haws
Just sneak up on em like a cat burglar and jump their bones

Yup
Bryan Samuelson
Teezer is the voice of reason
Edward Ekstrom
Haha, good ol' bible stories.
Also the most romantic verses in the bible were said by Ruth to Naomi
Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.

It's true, but I vote we pardon him
Colby Condie
We must wait for the patriarch's approval
zach fackrell
9 Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin.

10 I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.

When did we append "baby" to your nickname "colbinsky," making it "colbinski's baby?"
Brayden Haws
Eddy we did that when we ate lunch outside of babinskis baby that one day while waiting for John to pick us up
Edward Ekstrom
Oh yeah.
haha we're hilarious.
Colby Condie
Jared: I started at like 10.20 with 15% extra peak time. So about 11.70ish an hour. I think that's what they start at

Eddy: yes haws is correct
Brayden Haws
We got molca and then took it and ate it in front of costa vida
Genius
Edward Ekstrom
So I got one of those air dusters to clean out my keyboard.
They put this nasty taste on it so people don't do whipits.
but now my fingers get the taste all over them and I touch my face a lot when I program
Merit Egan
I'm used to the flavor now
Edward Ekstrom
so now my face just tastes nasty all of the time
It sucks
Colby Condie
Haha I've seen those eddy

Brayden Haws
Tyson what are your feelings on David villa coming to NYC
Tyson Amundsen
Did it go official this morning?
Brayden Haws
Yeah it did
Tyson Amundsen
I really like the move. He's a good player, hard worker. He'll do well here. I'm also surprised he'd leave Atletico Madrid right now. They basically just had a Moneyball-esque season which was incredible
He's going to the World Cup with Spain. That's a huge deal
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's kinda What I thought, like he's doing too well to leave
Merit Egan
Is it true that Messi is coming to RSL next spring?
Brayden Haws
Follow up/related question Teezr: if you were a high profile player leaving Europe is kreis your top pick for coach you wanna play for? Obviously the team and organization also matter but based purely on coaching?
Tyson Amundsen
I would say it doesn't matter much. I'm not sure any MLS coach is internationally recognized at this point. Maybe Bruce Arena. But Kreis will get there I think
I'm not sure what role the coach played in this kind of decision. Villa is probably getting more money for longer in the states at his age. Plus he is the first player ever for NYCFC. That's some good notoriety. All Kreis had to do was make a old impression to seal the deal I imagine
Erstwhile, most of you should know this: Fernando Torres is going to the World Cup with Spain! Amazing. Didn't have a great year and they picked him over Negredo of Man City and Llorente of Juventus
In reality its a sketchy move, but I love Torres
#SoccerMonday
Colby Condie
Kreis is only 9 years older than Villa too

My mom texted me saying I'm awesome... But she put a winky face at the end. "You're so awesome ;)" Not that it matters in this instance, but what does a wink mean in texting? I've always thought it meant like, they're joking.. Kinda like a way to show sarcasm in texting... So, thanks mom. Haha
Alex Crawford
Haha Seth. that's definitely parental disapproval right there.
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Fuh you Jared, that's awesome
Colby Condie
Dude Jared I almost applied at the CIA as an Italian translator. They pay freakin good. But you have to pass several way intense background checks
Alex Crawford
What kind of felonies did you have Colby that kept you out?
Merit Egan
In his past, Colby had a 2nd degree felony for tardiness. However, once regaining his freedom, Colby really turned his life around. He doesn't mess around with the things that got him in trouble in the past.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Seth Vance
I think it's for the better Colb didn't get the CIA job. If you're late to work they do more than just fire you...

Specialized Allez will be a good bike and won't be $5000
Or another viable option is LDL
KSL I mean
You can usually find good stuff on there for a reasonable price
Colby Condie
can i get something good for like 300
Seth Vance
Yeah, probably not new though.. Crawdad bought an old road bike a couple years ago on ksl.. I think he got it for less than 200
It treats him right
Colby Condie

Seth Vance
Trek specialized giant fezzari
Scott and Jamis would also be good. and my personal favorite, nishiki. Though I don't know if they make bikes anymore. Haha

Merit, opine on the pick
Colb
Colby Condie
I don't know much about Quin to be honest. Was he an assistant with the Hawks before the Jazz?
Brayden Haws
Yeah he designed the hawks offense last season which would be great for us if our players can shoot the ball reliably
Apparently when he was at Missouri he may have had problems with cocaine
That will make al like him
Tyson Amundsen
And me. The Des News paint him as somewhat different then a typical Jazz guy
Outside the box
Also can the real Jared Carter please stand up? Where were you last night
Brayden Haws
Today we were also discussing that he looks like he could be a villain in a movie
Merit Egan
I'm not sure how I feel about the hire. I don't know a ton about him. It doesn't get me way excited, but I hear he is a very good defensive coach.
Tyson Amundsen
Which gets Bryan stoked of course
Jared Carter
Tyson I apologize I was playing a little body body body with the toilet bowl.

Check out @wrightthompson's Tweet: https://twitter.com/wrightthompson/status/476416542981107712
Haws if you have time at work that's an interesting read. About the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, held during the Dirty War when Argentina was ruled by a military dictatorship. Over 30,000 people were taken by the govt and completely disappeared. They would fly them out over the ocean in big planes and push prisoners out from high elevation
And the national stadium was right next to a torturing facility. There's some pretty scary anecdotes from there
Brayden Haws
Oh I'll read it
I read an article earlier today about how the stadium in Brazil isn't finished yet and won't get any test runs before the cup
Tyson Amundsen
It's really a big mess
Brayden Haws
They have however been importing a lot of prostitutes to mate sure everyone's sexual needs are met. So at least that is ready

Merit Egan
Got a quick final exam at 5:30. Anyone got any cheats or info on the Gordon DCF model or the Net Present Value vs. Internal Rate of Return?
Brayden Haws
Never put your money in the bank, hide it in your mattress, that's the gist of it
Jared Carter
Let's play some frolf haws
Brayden Haws
Jared lets play, come get swoll with me
Edward Ekstrom
Alright guys
I need a quick referral.
I have a crack in my windsheild and I need it to pass inspection.
Jared Carter
That's my favorite game. Are you really going today.
Edward Ekstrom
Who knows a guy who will pass for me?
Brayden Haws
I'll ask kasey, there's a place in west j that passes anyone she says
Jared Carter
I'll pass that for you. I'm certified.. .well was. . . About three years ago.
Edward Ekstrom
Yes!
Jared, can you still do it?
Jared Carter
Is the crack bigger than a dollar?
Edward Ekstrom
yes
it's huge.
but its allong the outside edge
so it's not dangerous.

Can you see it?
Jared Carter
Mentally and physically yes. Legally no. But if it's not on the drivers half and is smaller than a dollar you should be able to pass it anywhere
Edward Ekstrom

It's long
Jared Carter
Defiantly bigger than a dollar. Your gonna have to give him your watch to get him to pass that one.
Merit Egan
I hear if you pee on your windshield, it fixes cracks. But you have to be standing on the roof.
Something about the acidic properties of pee and moving to a more oxygen concentrated environment.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha thanks for that merit
F my range rover window is 500 freaking dollars to replace
Merit Egan
You can buy a water bottle for a dollar. That'll fill your bladder.
Edward Ekstrom
I just want a sketchy Mexican to pass me
Merit Egan
Car registration is so gay. Here, give us a couple hundred bucks, and you can have this shiny sticker.
And safety and emissions are gay. OK I'm gonna go see if you brakes work ok?
Yeah I think they work cause I didn't crash into your building. Dip shi
Edward Ekstrom
I know, I hate the government
Merit Egan
Obama is gonna make our cars get healthcare soon.
ObamaCar
Jared Carter
Just wait till you get a ticket. Seriously. That'll be cheaper. Its like a 50 dollar fix it ticket.
Edward Ekstrom
No he's going to take our cars
I don't need safety!
Yes!
Jared Carter
Your a programmer Zach does photos. Just make your own shiny sticker.
Merit Egan
Zach has that sticker maker
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
guys, I only need emissions
best day ever
just saved 500$ on can insurance with Geico
but not really
just on not having to get a new windshield.
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
This one time when I went to get my xterra inspected I had just put new brake pads on that day and then they told me I couldn't pass because my car was braking too fast and they couldn't get a full read out on the sensor
Basically it was too safe, I had to go home and loosen the brake pads to pass
Fuh the government
Edward Ekstrom
That's the gayest thing I've ever heard
Colby Condie
Hahaha great GIF
Merit Egan
This one time, my ac was broken, so I took it to the shop. They quoted me at $550. I said f that, I'll just be hot. Then haws says dude man dude I can fix that. Haws gave me courage and one Saturday I bought the part for $50 and fixed it. #blessed #hawsknows
Once again
Edward Ekstrom
#hawsstrong
Colby Condie
Also a lot of times all the car needs is anti-freeze. It takes like 30 seconds to put it in but car shops try and charge you hundreds and act like it's broken
Merit Egan
Yeah they is gay. My ac compressor fan was broken. Took like 3 hours for me, the worst mechanic in the world. They could have done it in an hour tops. #fags #faggots #faggotiers
Brayden Haws
Yeah they're idiots, everyone tries to screw us over but merit showed them, didn't even need tools he just used gorilla glue
Edward Ekstrom
Nice guys. I love is, we never let people screw us.
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Wow. What an article. She says she is shocked and dismayed? And that she hasn't said anything against church doctrine? Idk how she figured that one out
Also I was surprised about the guy who estimated between 10k-20k people are X'ed each year. Can that be right?
Brayden Haws
Yeah I'm not sure how she can really say she hasn't spoken against church doctrine
And the number ex'ed was a shocker to me as well, I never would have guessed that high, if indeed that figure is correct
Tyson Amundsen
I really doubt it. 15 million members. Can we say a third are active? Or is that too generous. How many
Brayden Haws
I think the most recent estimate was 4 mil
Tyson Amundsen
Ok. I still feel that number is too high of X
Colby Condie
I just don't understand how someone who served a mission can say women should have the priesthood. I don't care if the worst missionaries ever say it, there is zero doctrine or reason in the history of planet earth to lead anyone in saying the women should have the priesthood
Brayden Haws
Yeah so do I. It's hard to say cause the church doesn't release that info
Thursday, June 12, 2014 11:31 AM
Tyson Amundsen
So who wants to watch Brazil vs Croatia at 2 pm? Or do we record it to all watch together after Chronic terror? Looking at you Colby
Colby Condie
I work 12-6 today. I could maybe watch it after chronic
Tyson Amundsen
What do you want to do
Others, chime in
Bryan Samuelson
I'm gonna be honest, I'm gonna watch it live. But I would potentially watch it again after chronic if people wanted to
John Sherwood
I want to watch after chronic
Brayden Haws
If we watch live I'd watch a bit, if delayed I'll have to miss it
Alex Crawford
So the ordain women lady was on the radio from hell show this morning. Let me summarize what she said. She had 3 points she was basing all her claims from.
Tyson Amundsen
This will be good
I read a little article
Edward Ekstrom
Crawdaddy, what were they?
Brayden Haws
Thank you in advance crawdad
Alex Crawford
1. Emma Smith was the reason Joseph asked The Lord about tobacco and then the WOW was receive. So she claims the revelation wasn't received until it was asked about.
2. She claimed that the leadership has not asked The Lord about the issue and claims that if they do she will be justified.
3. Someone asked if they have asked The Lord an the answer was no would she give up. Her answer was that we have been instructed to weary The Lord with our petitioning. So pretty much she said even of The Lord said no through the established channels of revelation she wouldn't accept that. Sound like Korihor to anybody else? Has she even read the Book of Mormon?
After that response all my bad opinions of her were justified and I turned off the interview.
She also quoted Mathews "ask and ye shall receiv"e verses as meaning if the church asks for women priesthood they will get it.
Or something to that effect.
I bet you could find the whole interview on X96's site.
Brayden Haws
So pretty much her view is that if we just keep asking god for things contrary to his will he'll just give in and give then to us?
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha geez
An excellent summary Crawdad
Brayden Haws
That's like when Joseph kept asking to share the manuscript and finally god let him. It was worthless at that point, as would be them getting the priesthood
Tyson Amundsen
Where is the scripture about wearying?
Nice profile pic merit
Merit Egan
I am changing my opinion on the matter. Give women the priesthood. Let's have them set up chairs before church and attend ward leadership meetings early on Sunday morning. The young women would learn a lot while going around and gathering fast offerings. Let's have women bishoprics and stake presidents that don't get home to see their families until 9. I'm for it!
Alex Crawford
Teezer you're right. I couldn't find the wearying reference she made in the scriptures. I only found this. "33 Therefore, let them cease wearying me concerning this matter. (Doctrine and Covenants, Doctrine and Covenants, D&C 90)"
Let's send that to her.
Tyson Amundsen
Haws, any thought on the wearying thing?
Brayden Haws
I've never heard any scripture with language like that and I doubt any would exist because god would never instruct us go keep asking for things he said no to
There's def examples of gods servants repeatedly asking for strength or faith to fulfill a righteous purpose and in that manner we should weary god. But never to try and get things contrary to his will
Colby Condie
Like in the Bible dictionary under "prayer" it states:

The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. (Prayer)
Brayden Haws
Colb I think that's a great point and I think if that was there attitude id be more willing to back them, if they had the attitude of wanting to learn gods will for them. But rather they're basically saying that we need to tell the brethren and god that they need the priesthood, which is contrary to the manner of prayer
Tyson Amundsen
Good commentary
Bryan Samuelson
As far as I can tell "weary The Lord until he blesses you" is a quote from Joseph Smith from an 1839 discourse
But I think she's clearly using it on the wrong context
the way I see it, that quote fits in with the definition of prayer in the Bible dictionary that Colb shared. "Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings." So we are to weary the Lord in order to obtain the blessings that He is already willing to grant, but that does not mean we should continue seeking for things that He has already revealed to be against His will
Tyson Amundsen
Way to weigh in Bryan
Merit Egan
Teezer, I wish to know your Outlook on the USA making it out of the group. Give me a %.
Tyson Amundsen
A percentage will be hard. Lemme think. I will say this- if I were a gambling man I wouldn't put money on the USA. at the same time, I honestly think we have a chance to get out
I do believe we have the capability.
we've done things like this before. in 2002 in Korea Japan, we beat Portugal and tied South Korea to get out of the group. That's was remarkable. We went on to win out second round game too that time
so we can do it. But it really will take our best performances.
I'd say less than 50%. Perhaps 35%

Worst article ever
Tyson Amundsen
I heard about that. But my phone won't load it. Doesn't it say that soccer needs to change its rules in order for America to like it?
Idiots
Bryan Samuelson
I glanced at it, so dumb. Makes all Americans sound like oafs
Brayden Haws
Yeah, that they need to get rid of off sides
And have judges who score the match like boxing judges so that way if the game ends in a tie they can declare a winner
Tyson Amundsen
That's not smart at all
Brayden Haws
No way stupid
The guy is a jackass to say the least
Tyson Amundsen
Meanwhile I'm watching Cameroon and Mexico play in a torrential downpour

Jazz send Hayward and a pick to Philly. Philly send Carter Williams to Cleveland with something. Cleveland sends us the 1
Merit Egan
I'd do it
Tyson Amundsen

It's an intriguing offer. If they figure we're gonna lose Hayward anyway then it makes sense.

Edward Ekstrom
Did Zach tell you guys how we uploaded 16 gigabytes of video in about 20 minutes the other day.  #googleFiber #blessed
zach fackrell
It was a modern miracle.
Edward Ekstrom
Did that lady get off your back?
zach fackrell
Normal internet estimated 42 hours to doit..
Edward Ekstrom
Did she pay you the full amount?
zach fackrell
Took eddy less than 42 min
Ya man she stopped her whining. I think I will get te full amount
Brayden Haws
What was it for?
Edward Ekstrom
Zach's works
zach fackrell
I filmed a commercial thingy for a security surveillance company then had to send the footage to California.
I tried uploading it before my Alaska trip but it failed like 5 times
Brayden Haws
Stupid dresses
Stupid internets
Colby Condie
Eddy did you sell your motorcycle?
Edward Ekstrom
Yes
Who is watching argentina?
Quick goal.
zach fackrell
Not me.
How fast?
Edward Ekstrom

And time
Brayden Haws
Do you work John?
John Sherwood
Til 5
Brayden Haws
Who works? Roll call, I vote we watch live
False we watch once you're off
John Sherwood
Who works and til when? Colb, I'm gong to be honest... I dont want to watch at your house. Brian will tip us off.
Brayden Haws
I don't work
Bryan Samuelson
I work till six
Brayden Haws
Therefore free at all times
Bryan Samuelson
My house is an option for viewing
John Sherwood
A 630 start time is possible but we need full commitment to not find out the outcome... airplane mode, cd in the car, etc..
That's why we need to set a time and place today
Brayden Haws
I'd watch then, I'll smash my phone with a hammer that's how committed I am
No doubt in my mind
How's that for a reference
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good Haws. John's absolutely right. It's a very delicate operation. I'm fully committed, we just need to decide on a locale
Colby Condie
Haha haws. Uncle Rico.
My house is open but I'm fine with whatever. We can do Bryan's house.
I'm on call for work tomorrow so I won't find out when I'm off til the morning
zach fackrell
I'm in for a 6;30 watch.
I'll be swimming all day at the pool with my phone in my swimsuit. That's how committed I am
Colby Condie
I'll skip work, go hike mount Olympus then throw my phone off a cliff. That's my commitment.
Bryan Samuelson
Shall we say my house at 6:30?
Brayden Haws
I'm in
Colby Condie
Me 2 ️
John Sherwood
I'm going airplane mode. #commitment and yes I'm in.
Merit Egan
#spoileralert USA wins!
John Sherwood
Well we all knew that.. we just dont want to know if we hit the 10 goal threshold

Merit Egan
Shall we do a prediction fifa match tonight?
John Sherwood
I want to. Lord knows I want to
Brayden Haws
Oh you all know I want to
I need to know the prediction
Merit Egan


Bryan Samuelson
Alas I cannot tonight
Brayden Haws

John Sherwood

John Sherwood
I'm in. I'll be there at 630. At 4, my phone is going on radio silence
Brayden Haws
I'm going airplane mode at 4 and banning myself from any espn stations
Merit Egan
All radio is a liability with the world cup. I will listen only to books on tape
John Sherwood
Cds are safe
Colby Condie
I will shut off my radio completely. Or even rip it out and throw it out the window while driving down the freeway
Brayden Haws
I'll sell my car so I can't listen to the radio in it
Merit Egan
I'm gonna crash into 50 cars on the freeway so that the news talks about that instead of the game. #sacrificebringsforththeblessingsofworldcup
Edward Ekstrom
Zach, did you watch the netherlands game?
and what happened with Uruguay?
zach fackrell
Netherlands game was amazing! Then uruguay just played urugay

I propose a location change. Let's set up that cable shiz on the projector at Zach's pool and watch from there. Sure it's a little windy, but who gives a rat's butt.
Brayden Haws
I went with Collin to the fanzz today. They have super nice jazz underarmor pants and jackets for 10 bones
I'm with merit, I'll freeze my ah off for this team
Merit Egan
Haws, i want to go to fanzz, probably tomorrow after 5. or wednesday after 5, or thursday after 5
Brayden Haws
I could go weds
They have so much stuff. Once a rack is empty they just roll a new one out
Merit Egan
I'm in. Wednesday shopping spree. Where is it?
zach fackrell
Get some underarmor body suits for the pool and No one has to freeze their rat butts
Brayden Haws
It by the airport
Most the stuff they have is pretty lame but you can find a couple cool things
The vast majority is Vick eagles jerseys and Sanchez jets
Merit Egan
Oh baby. I want one of them sanchez jerseys so i can always remember the butt funble
*fumble
Brayden Haws
I got a Tebow jets one
#turkeybowl

Got this sweet shirt
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Haha good good
Merit Egan
Is it time? Cam we still google vox?
Brayden Haws
It's starting.
I'll get on my laptop
Merit Egan
I Merit Egan, solemnly swear that I will not spoil anything about the USA Soccer match on this, the 16th of june.
I also vow to not look up anything online, or hear anything via the radio, or may my eyes and ears be ravaged by wolves.
welp...it looks like everyone has gone radio silent
Brayden Haws
I just deleted my espn app
Commuted
Committed
Alex Crawford
Colby, I'm coming. But dumb coworker just dropped by with a play by play into my office. The radio silence was penetrated by the uncontrollable.
Merit Egan
BREACH!!!!!!!
Brayden Haws
Kill em
Merit Egan
Keep the line secure.
we cannot let a breach into the vox
Alex Crawford
Haha don't worry. I'm like stonewall Jackson. The buck stops here. Windows firewall. Hellen Keller.
Merit Egan
Make sure you are not followed. We cannot let our homebase location known
Alex Platis
Guys that USA-Germany game was great, but why are there so many black players on the German team?
Brayden Haws
I haven't checked twitter for so long, I'm going insane
Also were enroute
Jared Carter
Are you all at colby's?
Brayden Haws
Jared come
Quickly
We need you
Jared Carter
Okay hold on I'm coming in a sec.
Brayden Haws
Jared it's been so long
Jeff Knudsen
Have you guys watched the game yet or not?
Merit Egan
it has been watched at colbs
Jeff Knudsen
So just for clarification, you know the end match results...?
all of you?
Merit Egan
i believe so. I cant speak for eddy and jared
Jeff Knudsen
USA crowd chants "I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win!"  Wow that game was stressful.  Lame we lost Altidore though
Colby Condie
Yeah that sucks to lose Jozy
Jeff Knudsen
I mean I was just getting to meet him with a friendly, bonjour

I'm only in the fake stock market with members from this chat.
I do own 1 stock in real life. It's worth half a penny and I have 38000 shares

Happy Birthday Btown

John Sherwood
:)
Good for one free redemption of ice cream/snow cone. Non transferable
For sman
Bryan Samuelson
Haha thanks gents
Colby Condie

Happy bday BSam
Edward Ekstrom
The big ONE-SIX! Stay off the roads everyone.
Merit Egan
Happy birthday bsam. Tonight we eat cake!
Brayden Haws
Guys lets take an insta poll, do you think the name redskins is offensive and should Washington have to change their team name?
Merit Egan
I'm torn on the subject. I don't know enough about how native americans view the word, but from what I've heard, it is very offensive to them. If that is the case, they probably should change it.
We couldn't have a team named the Philadelphia N-words. So if it is of similar offense, then I can see why it would need to be changed.
However, the Utes is not an offensive or derogatory team name, so if Redskins is closer to that, then they shouldn't have to change it
Seth Vance
Dudes, did you see tim Cahill's goal for the Australians? Sweet as!
Brayden Haws
Sizzler, what a blessed day
Bryan Samuelson
Certainly was a beaut
Seth Vance
A blessed day indeed! Happy birth anniversary bry
All goals scored today are in honor of Bryan.
Edward Ekstrom
Seth, that was the sickest goal in this world cup BY FAR!
Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Hahaha
Chile over Spain?!?!
Bryan Samuelson
Unbelievable.
Also, Vargas for chile has the Jordan logo tattooed on his neck haha
Colby Condie
Guys it's a curse to win the World Cup. In 2010 Italy didn't win a game and they won it in 2006. Now Spain is the defending champs and haven't won yet
Merit Egan
USA USA USA!

Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, do soccer players wear cups?
Brayden Haws
I feel like cups are a myth, no athletes ever wear them
Edward Ekstrom
I'd take winning the world cup and losing all of your group matches at the next one over 2 second place finishes in a row.
Bryan, what are you doing for your birthday?
Bryan Samuelson
I took work off and watched the World Cup. It was nice. We're having dessert at my house later, all X'cerpt invited
Brayden Haws
What time Bryan?
Bryan Samuelson
About 9:00
Brayden Haws
K we may be over in a bit. Just left the temple. I had to wait like an hour for kasey, it took an hour and a half to do 5 iniatories
Bryan Samuelson
Which temple? I've had that exact experience at Draper
Brayden Haws
Salt lake
I got done in like 20 mins. Just had to read scriptures for so long
Bryan Samuelson

Merit Egan
I place a heavy vote on FIFA
Colby Condie
While watching fake FIFA..
Merit Egan
Colby knows.
I have a dream, that one day, we will have 7 players on the pitch, and that day is today.
Brayden Haws
I believe we will play feef
I believe we will play feef
I believe we will play feef

John Sherwood
I'm going to a reception at 7. Then... we feef. The girls can talk and pillow fight and play with simon
Colby Condie

Merit Egan

Colby Condie
The Italy/Costa Rica match is playing on the TV at the branch I'm at today. #blessed
Brayden Haws
I have to go to stupid Lehi tonight to meet baxters dah creepy fiancé, but I still wanna play, pre and post
Merit Egan
That was a sweet goal. Colby, my apologies.
beautiful cross
Colby Condie
Haha haws. He is creepy.
And blast it was a good goal. So gay though. A header off the crossbar. Unlucky for Italia
John Sherwood
I don't mean to toot my own horn. But this is comedic gold
Merit Egan
haha, that indeed got a chuckle out of me.
Brayden Haws
John your spree of cyclops tweets were a great way to start my day
Colby Condie

Stupid Costa Rica
Sorry colbinsk

The desires of my heart

Thanks dudes. I might loose service on the drive just wanted to see who can bring what. ️
Colby Condie
Who is down to party tonight?
Calling all partyers
Merit Egan
Me!
Jeff will come, but we need numbers before we have him drive from provo.
Bsam?

Bryan Samuelson
Zach I can bring just about any of those things. We have contact with teezer. He's coming to watch the USA game at my house in like 30 minutes. After that I would love to party
John Sherwood
I can bring stuff too. Z: is it going to be an enormous party or just regular? Like can we play games or just wade in the water? X: reception at 8. Party after. Y? Cuz we cool
XYZ
Brayden Haws
I sure hope we can play games
John Sherwood
Will there be a dj? I think that will be a good gauge
Merit Egan
Come one come all for feef

Edward Ekstrom
Edge of tomorrow us sweet
Tyson Amundsen
USA!!!
Welcome home Teez!
Feefa!
John Sherwood
Good teez
Bryan Samuelson
John where art thou? And Colb?
John Sherwood
We are at the minnicks. Turning in for the night soon
Tyson Amundsen
I second John's question to Zach
Saturday, June 21, 2014 5:24 AM
zach fackrell
Hey guys sorry I'm just seeing this. I'm about to go to sleep in prep for the party.

Sam the ball kicker is gonna DJ.

Bring enough chips and drinks and snacks for our friends plus our friends friends (like 15-20)
I told Jeremy to get his friends to bring stuff too

I feel like it'll be slightly larger than normal but not mega huge or anything.

We're playing games. We have to.
It's a birthday party. Games have to be played!
How's that for a gosh darn reference?


Tyson - paper goods and cups

Bryan - chips

Haws - dessert

Eddy- dessert

Colb - drinks

Merit - drinks

John-dessert or drinks ?


Feel free to swap and trade assignments.
I'll be getting hotdogs and burgers.

It's gonna be fun. Just come ready to have a good time.
I'm not worried
John Sherwood
I'll get drinks. And a dessert.
Colby: you've seen this because: A. you're already up? B. You woke up because you're restless? Or C. You hadn't gone to sleep yet. What do you think X?
I'd say B
If that's the case... there is nothing to be worried about the wedding. Impotence is common among tons of people.. you can always talk to me colb.
I like this conversation with myself
Colby Condie
Ha actually it's neither. Not to dampen the mood or anything, but my parents woke me up to inform me my grandpa Condie passed away last night. Sad day but his health was waning
John Sherwood
Oh pissant. Deepest apologies. Disregard all prior voxes from me. Except the impotence one. That's a good one
John Sherwood
And actually no.. don't disregard the voxes. I'm just not done creating the answers.... oor... D. Colby is best. He does not have his own time zone. And grandpa condie is the man and we'll miss him too.
I erased the line in B and made it into a D
Edward Ekstrom
Condolences Colbinsky.
Colby Condie
Ha well put John. Thanks bretheren
Brayden Haws
Colb sorry to hear the news
John what a spree of choose your own adventure voxes
zach fackrell
Sorry Colby. We're here for you man.
John Sherwood
Watch party at tzrs house. Germany ghana. I'll see you all there. Starts at 1
Tyson Amundsen
Zach report in. Also, those who wish to watch Ghana vs. Germany, report to my house at once
Colby Condie
I'm coming now Tyson
Brayden Haws
And with that the players head back to the tunnel
Edward Ekstrom
Brazil has the most world cups. Therefore, my mission is the best.
If Brazil has won the most world cups, then Eddy's mission was the best.
Merit Egan
That's a good proof there.
Colby Condie
Italy has the second most world cups with four. But Italy won more recent than Brazil. So does that mean Italy is tied with Brazil for the best mission?
Bryan Samuelson
Alaska is the best mission. And that's the bottom line. Cuz stone cold said so
Brayden Haws
Arizona is chock full of drunk Indians, therefore my mission was the worst
We're bringing donuts
#thuglife
Brayden Haws
Tyson what are you thoughts on ballacks blatant support of Germany. Can he be an effective commentator in that manner?
Tyson Amundsen
It doesn't bother me. He's German. I'm fine with him supporting them cuz I still think he makes fair comments
But I really like this commentary in general. It seems way less in your face, which I think NFL and NBA commentators can be
Brayden Haws
Me as well. I actually thought
It was cool and something different to see, I think most sports they try to find people who are neutral or who won't express their views
I like seeing that these guys actually care
Colby Condie
Yeah when talking about countries, I think it's fine to be a little biased. It adds to the feeling of country pride
Edward Ekstrom
I think anyone who supports Germany is a Commie.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:26 PM

Inspired by Blake Cope's tweet, I recommend everyone wear your eagle/American flag ties to church today #USMNT #beatportugal #OrdainKlinsmann
Also Bryan, I have arraigned my schedule to accept a 420 start time at your house
arranged, as it were
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good Teezer. And I appreciate your sacrifice. All are welcome at my house at 4:20
Alex Platis
Ayoooo happy birthday Zeez

Merit Egan
It looked oh so promising
Tyson Amundsen
Check out @devinpleuler's Tweet: https://twitter.com/devinpleuler/status/480863250788392961
USA advance scenarios.
1. Win and in
2. Tie and in
?
Colby Condie
Yes a win would be so comforting for us. Eliminates all talk
Tyson Amundsen
Loss and in of Portugal and Ghana tie
If
John Sherwood
What if we lose and ghana beats portugal by 10?
Tyson Amundsen
I believe any win out of that game is bad for us. But if we tie we are in no matter what
John Sherwood
So a loss and a non draw and we go.home?
Tyson Amundsen
Correction. A loss for us and a non star from them creates a goal differential scenario
non draw
Merit Egan
Portugal would have to win by a lot to beat us in a goal differential right?
They are -4
We are +1
Colby Condie
If we lose and Portugal wins then don't we still advance? Cause they have a terrible goal differential from the Germany game
Merit Egan
So as long we don't get slammed by Germany and they slam Ghana we should be good.
Bryan Samuelson
Here's a more detailed
Look
https://twitter.com/kellerandy/status/480886761401647105

Brayden Haws
Bryan I gotta be honest I have no idea what that chart is talking about
#howipodsaremade
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha good Haws
Tyson Amundsen
Haha hilarious Haws
But Bryan that's a better chart
Essentially we root for a tie or Portugal. Of we lose and Ghana wins by 2 we are toast
Bryan Samuelson
Correct
Colby Condie
It's amazing how we were 15 seconds away from not even having this conversation. But that's in the past and we move on to Germany
Brayden Haws
Tyson can you provide us an analysis on Bradley this World Cup
?
Ian darke hasn't been a fan
Tyson Amundsen
I'd call his first performance pedestrian, which by his standard is poor
Lots of giveaways.
Today he was better, but the more i ponder the more I am baffled how he gave the ball away for their last goal. If we want to point fingers, I point at him
So on the whole I think he has been merely alright, decent. But really everyone expects more and we will need more
Colby Condie
I think we can also point a finger at Cameron that play in the 5th minute. I know after that he played really well but that play was crucial as well
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah. I love Cameron, but what a gaffe
Brayden Haws
As someone that is obviously not qualified to analyze him that what I thought, felt like he kept giving the ball away everyone he touched it
Colby Condie
Also I think it should be said that Beckerman has played well so far. No big mistakes or excessive give aways. Solid play
Merit Egan
Beckerman is the man. That Bradley turnover was poor. That Dempsey guy is good. Traore played great.
Brayden Haws
Traore had some great runs
Colby Condie
http://m.mlssoccer.com/worldcup/2014/news/article/2014/06/22/world-cup-us-national-team-advance-win-or-draw-against-germany?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=WorldCup&utm_campaign=Unpaid
This scenario possibility is much clearer for me
Monday, June 23, 2014 7:25 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Cameron was seemingly being paid by Portugal to give then the ball.
Bradley*
Whoever the guy with the head that looks like a wiener is.
Merit Egan
Haha
Not knowing much about Bradley, and not watching him play much before, I'm quite disappointed.
Monday, June 23, 2014 1:30 PM
Edward Ekstrom
I tried to picture clusters of information...
Colby Condie
Neymar is putting on a clinic in this first half.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha good eddy
Colby they play Cameroon?
Colby Condie
Yeah.
Merit Egan
Offsides?
Anyone see that goal by Brazil. Teez I would like an explanation.
Here is my drawing of the goal.
Tyson Amundsen
I will watch it and see. I just hiked Mt Olympus with Haws Collin and their brother in law, so I need to sit by the TV
Merit Egan
#3 was in an offside position when the ball was passed to #2, then #2 passed it to #3, maybe onside at this point, but it was right after the first pass. I was under the impression that he couldn't engage in the play.
Tyson Amundsen
If by the time 2 passes to 3 and 3 is onside at that time, he is good to go
Merit Egan
i see. I do believe he was still offside. I'll have to see a good replay.
Very close. We'll call it good.
And this was my initial question. But that is ok.
Tyson Amundsen
Kate Kelly officially excommunicated
http://img.ksl.com/slc/2526/252687/25268764.pdf
thats the bishop's letter to her. It's really good
zach fackrell
Ya I think It was very well written.
Merit Egan
Very good letter. I like the way he laid it out towards the end.
John Sherwood
Al platis and jeff Knudsen. I need your addresses. Wedding stuff
Merit Egan
Thoughts?
Alex Platis
1876 Queer Cougar Drive
Provo, UT
Colby Condie
oohh that's a lot we're giving up. I like Jarrett Jack though. I remember he was pretty good at Georgia Tech. Has he done much in the NBA though?
Alex Platis
Oh wait that's Jeff's address.
835 S Norton Ave
Apt 14
Los Angeles, CA 90005
Merit Egan
He was big on golden state 2 years ago. A good backup pg and small ball player. It is definitely a lot to give up.
Colby Condie
Alec Burks is taller and more athletic than Jarrett Jack in my opinion
Edward Ekstrom
I am the Bio-digital jazz man.
#tronQuote
I'm going to knock on the sky and listen to the sound..
#tronQuote
Merit Egan
Yeah Burks is better than Jack. It would suck to lose him too.
But I think I'd still do it.
Colby Condie
would we for sure pick Jabari if we got the number one? We should if we get it
Merit Egan
I think so. With Embid off the board Jabari looks like the lock for #1
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy keep 'em coming
zach fackrell
Goodluck tomorrow Colby #URUvsITA
Colby Condie
Colby vs Zach.
Winner advances on. Loser goes home. Huge match
zach fackrell

#tronQuote
Tyson Amundsen
Well done eddy
Morning kickstarter: does anyone here still keep a journal?
Brayden Haws
Nope
Unless twitter counts
Merit Egan
Negatory.
Unless twitter counts
John Sherwood
I do. Assuming twitter counts
Colby Condie
If Twitter is considered a journal, then yes.
Seth Vance
I write in my journal about as much as I use twitter.
#notmuch
Tyson Amundsen
Which is considerably more than you use the Google vox.
And infinitely more than you come home
Seth Vance
Haha agreed.
You're right
In coming home this weekend
Merit Egan
Mega Party....Engaged
Tyson Amundsen
Everyone bring your journals
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Hide yo kids hide yo wives. We're about to play fifa
Seth Vance
I'll be home late Saturday. But I don't work on Monday.
Brayden Haws
Seth thank goodness
We were worried you had does
Died
Or had been taken prisoner by a hipster slut
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I've had to address rumors about whether you are dead, married, gay, or all 3
Seth Vance
Hahahaws
I'm sorry I've been Mia so long guys
Brayden Haws
We need you here, party with us
Seth Vance
Party time, excellent..
Tyson Amundsen
Do you have any young pots up there?

Got a few I'm working with..
Chow
zach fackrell
️
Seth Vance
Where you going zach?
zach fackrell
I was saying Chau to the Italian red card
Tyson Amundsen
Lifeline for Uruguay. This should liven up the game
Red card was a little harsh for me
And Pirlo looks a little sloppy right now
Seth Vance
Who else has been watching World Cup in Spanish on Univision? Spanish announcers are great. Haha
Edward Ekstrom
I've watched a bunch on there, it's awesome
zach fackrell
Bite
Conejito
Edward Ekstrom
If Italy and Uruguay tie, who goes through?

But They're not gonna tie..

Geeeez
Colby Condie
Son of a bi
Tyson Amundsen
What an ending
Merit Egan
Wow
My condolences Colb. My congratulations Zeez.
zach fackrell
Those last minutes were freaky
Edward Ekstrom
Did you swear colby?
zach fackrell
Also Suarez needs a mouth guard
Tyson Amundsen
Yup. I think on the whole Italy may be a better team, but I'm not upset to be watching more Suarez and Cavani
At this point it didn't look bad to me
Merit Egan
Crazy that neither Italy or England made it out of that group
Tyson Amundsen
Truth
Merit Egan
I am honored that Tyson just awarded me with speaking soccer truth. #blessed
Colby Condie
Well I would've loved to see Italy advance. But my loyalty is first to the US of A like all of you my friends
Tyson Amundsen
The commentators are bugging me. It's innocent til proven guilty to me
Merit Egan
colby has his priorities #straight
John Sherwood
What happened?
Suarez got punched or something?
zach fackrell
Suarez *allegedly bit another guy.. #3rdtime
Merit Egan
http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/6/24/5838522/claudio-marchisio-italy-uruguay
zach fackrell
He did
Colby Condie
Suarez is crazy
John Sherwood
I dont like him. I'll say it again and I've said it before. I just said it too
Did he get a card for that? Will fifa let him play in the next game?
Brayden Haws
Who the hell bites someone
Mike Tyson
Merit Egan
cannibals
John Sherwood
Hannibal
Merit Egan
that guy that ate albatross soup
John Sherwood
Hahah
Brayden Haws
Just biting some sweaty person
Suarez must be some kinda perv
Merit Egan
haha
Tyson Amundsen
I'd like to see a close up and more angles. Suarez and Chiellini definitely knocked heads or something, bit frankly Chiellini is well known for diving. and i could see him trying to bait the ref
Merit Egan
once they have sweated, then let the sweat soak in during half time, then re-sweat, I just can't get enough of the taste.
Colby Condie
that red card for Marchisio's challenge was ridiculous.
Tyson Amundsen
And if he did bite him, wtf
Colby Condie
i just watched the play
Brayden Haws
Just stealing jerseys and sucking on em
Colby Condie
he barely pushed him. and the ball was right under Marchisio's feet
Edward Ekstrom
I want to see the biting.
Seth Vance
I wish sabo could play
I'd love to see him get some goals for the ticos
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly Seth
Edward Ekstrom
I just watched the replay.  Definitely looked like a biting haha
sick..
Bryan Samuelson
He bit someone?!! Again?! Goodness sakes
Colby Condie
he is so weird
John Sherwood
Someone get a gif on here of the biting
Colby Condie

Chiellini said he got bit on the shoulder
This is a bad angle but I don't think he's lying
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I don't like that angle. But I saw another one that sure looked like it. Freaking idiot
Brayden Haws
Travis got cleared to play today, idk if that's good or bad
Tyson Amundsen
I'd say bad
Colby Condie

Much better angle
Merit Egan
looks like a bite to me
Colby Condie
The patriarch declared it
zach fackrell
And so it was
Colby Condie
and they lived happily ever after
Seth Vance
Maybe he's a zombie
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson, what would happen if everyone tied 0-0 in all of their games of group play?

Definite penalty

zach fackrell
Warm, moist, desirable
Merit Egan
When will you be done?
zach fackrell
I'm coming home. I'll be there in 15
Brayden Haws
Nothing moist is desirable
If something is moist then it is not desirable
Mooooooiisssst
Tyson Amundsen
No one said moist

I have no problems with moist
Merit we'll be done by 10 at latest
Merit Egan
Come quick. I can't be out on the pitch to late

Joseph Gordon leavitt

Tyson Amundsen
No shower tomo morning Zach. Game then swim
zach fackrell
Deal
Thursday, June 26, 2014 7:46 AM
John Sherwood
If you guys go to ESA for the game. Come visit my work after
Colby Condie
Suarez is banned for nine international games and four months of any soccer related activity.
Thoughts?
Edward Ekstrom
John you started at fidelity?
Really?
Like for the world cup?
Colby Condie
Yeah effective today. He's out of rest of World Cup
Brayden Haws
I think it should be more, biting is super dangerous, you can pass stds that way
Colby Condie
Yeah I think it should be like a year ban
Edward Ekstrom
I think they should have sentenced him to go I guest appearance on walking dead.
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Seth Vance
Torrential rain in Recife... Flooding. Fans abandoning their cars to walk 17 miles to the stadium...
Tyson Amundsen
As they should
Jared Carter
Tys Did you get my text. My phone tripping out today
zach fackrell
Jared can't come anymore teez. It's just me and you. Meet at my place in 20
Seth Vance
Correct. I'm just hoping there's no delay of game.
John Sherwood
I hope there is a delay if game. If you guys go to esa I can come for the second half. Even if it's not delayed I think I will
Yes I started at fidelity last Monday. Just studying to be certified now
zach fackrell
Sweet ya man we're going.

Tyson do you have an extra USA jersey for me?
Edward Ekstrom
Sweet John.  Workin' man.
T - 40 minutes to game time!
ls
John Sherwood
Do you get to watch ed?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah I'll be watching at work.  No doubt in my mind
univision is awesome #blessed
Is your work strict about how you use the internet?
John Sherwood
No.. but right now I'm in a classroom and the facilitator already said no futbol. I think she's a nazi. A german nazi. Not the soup kind
Edward Ekstrom
Sucks..  So how are your hours at Fidelity?
Merit Egan
That bi. She for sure isn't American
John Sherwood
Right now I'm 8-5 everyday. Once I'm trained, I'll be 4 10 hour shifts which will be nice. I dont know which shifts yet though
Tyson Amundsen
She's an a**hole
John Sherwood
Has the game been delayed? Or is it going at 10?
Seth Vance
It's starting at 10
No delay
Brayden Haws
I'll give her a stunner John
I got my laptop set up behind the wall, no one knows but I'm watching
Edward Ekstrom
Question, if we loose and ghana or portugal win what happens?
Merit Egan
they have to win by enough to beat us in goal differential
so if anything, we want portugal to win by a small margin, cause they are -4 and we are +1
Brayden Haws
Fuh I think too many people are using watchespn cause it keeps crashing
Shi I hate my life
Edward Ekstrom
Use Univision
Brayden Haws
God bless you eddy
Merit Egan
Beckermania getting some love from the commentators
Bryan Samuelson
Why did Bradley decide to lose all sense of touch he ever had
Just can never keep the ball
Seth Vance
Good question
Merit Egan
haha seriously.
Just misses a touch at the top of the 18
Brayden Haws
Bradley had been horrible
Seth Vance
Kyle's been amazing though
We need buckets
Tyson Amundsen
After the first 10 we've held lur own
Our
Merit Egan
Yeah we looked terrible at the start
Couldn't keep possession like the ball was a greasy pig
Tyson Amundsen
Beckerman has been solid. And got away with his professional foul with no yellow on schweinsteiger
Bryan you made great comments. Bradley and Jones first touch auto struggle
All of you really
This is fantastic from our point of view
And Portugal has a goal. That is huge
Seth Vance
Did I hear Ian darke say that we can lose by two and if Portugal wins by two we still go through?
Brayden Haws
That is true Seth
Seth Vance
Okay, just making sure I heard right. Well were gonna win by two, so we'll go through anyway.
Colby Condie
If we tie this game it doesn't matter what happens in Ghana game. #prayfortieorwin
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy in this day and age how can ESPN be crashing from too many people
Brayden Haws
11:11 I wish USA wins
Edward Ekstrom
Serving up video requires a lot of internet bandwidth and server CPU.
both of which are expensive
and so they would have to plan in advance to pay temporarily for more of those from whoever they use (likely Amazon).
but if they plan on having 1 million people stream it and 2 million actually do.
you can't kick up 2x as many servers that fast
so you just live with some people not being able to watch
Portugal and Ghana are tied
that's great right?
Brayden Haws
Ozil is so ugly
Like a little golem
Tyson what can you tell me about mueller. I've seen lots of commentary that he's not very athletic or technically gifted but somehow fills it up
Brayden Haws
Merica!!!!!
Bryan Samuelson
Survive an advance bayba bayba
Colby Condie
We advance!!!
Edward Ekstrom
do we want belgium or algeria?
Bryan Samuelson

Belgium is much better. Much rather play Algeria
Edward Ekstrom
Okay cool
Is it still possible that that happens?
Seth Vance
One nation, underdog.
Also under God
Alex Crawford
Sweet MERCY, thanks be to Portugal this day.
Seth Vance
Muito brigado!
Alex Crawford
I don't speak Potugese Seth. And neither do you. What does that mean?
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah Ed it's possible, but unlikely. South Korea has to beat Belgium and Algeria has to beat Russia
Seth Vance
I speak very little. It means thank you. Thank you Portugal.
Alex Crawford
Eddy, is there a difference between Brazilian Portuguese and Portugals Portugese?
Colby Condie
I heard that Portugal Portuguese is more proper than Brazil Portuguese. Kind of similar to British English compared to American English. Is that true Eezle?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah there is a difference
There is more of a difference between Continental Portuguese (Portugal) and Brazilian Portuguese than there is between British English and American English
Merit Egan
We moving on
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes everyone!!!
zach fackrell
USA
Edward Ekstrom
so if ghana had won we would have gone home?
John Sherwood
Ya
Edward Ekstrom
goodness
Glory to God on high.
Merit Egan
I believe if they won by 1 and we lost by 1, then it would have been a coin toss
cause they were -1 and we were +1 in GD
Edward Ekstrom
Oh really?
but we beat them
that doesn't have anything to do with it?
Merit Egan
Teezer is the expert
Bryan Samuelson
No, if they won 2-1 and we lost 1-0 they would have done through over us because they would have scored more goals
The tie breakers are kind of
Dumb
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it.
Brayden Haws
Goal diff trumps who beat who
Edward Ekstrom
That's gay.
it should just be whichever country has more white people goes through.
#imNotARacisit
zach fackrell

We're fans of the idea
Merit Egan
So our goal diff would have been even in that situation, so the next tiebreaker is goals scored?
Colby Condie
That's retarded. The second tiebreaker should be decided by head to head result instead of goals scored.
Brayden Haws
http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/watch_stephen_colbert_team_usa_world_cup_2014_group_g_scenarios-2014-06
Did you get those shirts at esa?
Those are awesoem
Merit Egan
yeah, head to head should definitely be a major factor
Tyson has been quiet. I want to hear all the tiebreakers in order
Brayden Haws
I feel like one could be a coin flip
Merit Egan
I was under the impression that if points a GD were tied, that it came down to a coin toss. Based on somebody's chart that they posted.
points and GD
Brayden Haws
If that's is true that is stupid
Merit Egan
I looked it up. 1st tie breaker is goal differential, 2nd is goals scored, 3rd is head to head
So if they had won 2-1, they would have gone on. Bsam was the wise
Tyson Amundsen
Is head to head one of them?
I didnt know that
Merit Egan
head to head is #3
Tyson Amundsen
My brothers got those shirts in 1994. Original, Alexi Lalas Eric Wynalda era
Perhaps my favorite USA jersey ever
I discovered I only own 1 USA jersey plus those two old shirts
I really need a new jersey
Colby Condie
Let's get one Teezr
Brayden Haws
I want a USA jersey, I ask kasey j like every day
Merit Egan
#justdoit
Tyson Amundsen
I think I'd do white
I also think it will be $90. I don't know of a cheaper place
Merit Egan
Where is china when you need them
Tyson Amundsen
Someone find it. Search the deep web
Brayden Haws
Yeah the whites are 90
I've seen em
Felt em
Tried em on
Colby Condie
Yeah the replica is 90. I haven't seen cheaper anywhere. The authentic ones are 130 or something
zach fackrell
Guys come swim.
Team USA will be there
zach fackrell
Colby why do you hate us?
Colby Condie
Hate my friends?? Ain't nobody got time fo dat!

Merit Egan
haha
Colby Condie
Cavs make their pick in about 2 minutes
Tyson Amundsen
So the jazz didn't trade for it then
Weenie
And the butt
Colby Condie
Unless there's a last second trade. But I don't think the jazz will trade at this point
Brayden Haws
Still could but doubtful
Probably doing it in the butt right now
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Bryan Samuelson
They tried their hardest. Offered a shiz load or it
Colby Condie
Everyone pray to the almighty Zeus that Jabari gets passed up 4 times.
Probably a 1% chance of that happening
Tyson Amundsen
shiz
Brayden Haws
Mormon Miracle Draft
Tyson Amundsen
I predict the Jazz will draft...
Slobodan Milosevic
Brayden Haws
Allen Iverson, re-entering the nba to pay off his jewelry debts
Colby Condie
Wiggins went first
Brayden Haws
Jabari's gonna be in Milwaukee getting in bar fights with Larry sanders, forgetting the Mormon way
John Sherwood
Wow. Surprise
We can get exum
Or vonleh
Who.do you want sman?
Bryan Samuelson
I'll take Exum in a heartbeat
John Sherwood
Me 2
Bryan Samuelson
Ha I answered before you even asked. Tenure
Colby Condie
I don't want Marcus Smart
John Sherwood
I don't want smart at all
Bryan Samuelson
I concur John and Colb
John Sherwood
Exum!!!
Bryan Samuelson
Ayooo
Merit Egan
Wow. All of my wildest dreams have come true.
John Sherwood
I heard that we could possibly trade 23 for iman shumpert? I'd do that.
Colby Condie
Shumpert is way good. Has the sweetest flat top in the league. I'd do that for sure
Maybe NY is trying to free up some salary space and bring back Carmelo
Bryan Samuelson
It's always nice when you can swipe somebody for a team trying to clearest space
Cap*
Brayden Haws
New York is trying to get cap space and get into the draft cause right now there's no way Carmelo is coming back
Merit Egan
I'd take shumpert. Is his knee stable?
Colby Condie
He missed his first year with his knee injury but came back and looked fine I think. He's way athletic. Unless he injured it again it I'm not aware
Alex Crawford
Can you say no to a team and still get picked up by someone else or do you sign that right away when you enter the draft?
Brayden Haws
Basically that team owns the rights to you, if you wanna play in the nba you gotta play for them
Colby Condie
I think if you don't come to a contract agreement then you can become a restricted free agent. But I could be wrong on that
Brayden Haws
You could hold out and try and get them to trade you rights to another team
Alex Crawford
So what stops anybody from just saying they don't want to do the draft and then the next year trying out for any team they want?
Brayden Haws
I may be wrong but I think if you wanna get into the nba you have to enter the draft, if you're not drafted then you become a free agent, but you at least have to enter
The idea is to provide competitive balance, but in comparison to real world careers it makes no sense
John Sherwood
I would think it's a matter of pride and teammansship. Made that up. But if you are a diva and dont enter, I think the guys would not like you that much
Merit Egan
Yeah, there has to be some rule in place. I know you can refuse to go to the team that drafts you, then after 4 years the rights expire and you are a free agent.
Some foreigners have stayed overseas and done that.
John Sherwood
Is neto playing with us this year. If so, we are young. And we are awesome
Brayden Haws
Duke Bryan
John Sherwood
That's about as good of sports day as it gets boys
Colby Condie
Indeed indeed
Merit Egan
Agreed. Usa, nba draft, Chronic terror
Bryan Samuelson
I was just thinking that. Beautiful
John Sherwood
I forgot to address this at chronic.. remember when I rebounded over the guy and he just screamed the F word? The words power stunned me and he stole the ball
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Merit Egan
Haha is that what happened near the 3 point line that one play. I remember being very confused.
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha yeah I was on the bench and got a great view of it
Friday, June 27, 2014 1:38 PM
Brayden Haws
What's the plans tonight vox nation?
Merit Egan
I would love a late night swim, or a late night feef. Even a late night body body. Starting around 8:30?
John Sherwood
I've entered in a spikeball tournament tonight. I will report once the competition has been concluded. I'd do any of those things.. but not til 10 I'd assume
Brayden Haws
I would enjoy all of merits ideas
John may the odds ever be in your favor
zach fackrell
Swizz. I love those ideas too
Colby Condie
I'm ready to party after about 8:30
Merit Egan
Can i bet on the spikeball tournament. I'm almost as sure you will win as I am sure that you 2 would win a scatterball tournament.
Brayden Haws
I'll lay a 1000 down on John
No doubt in my mind
Merit Egan
Do we try to do multiple ideas tonight, or choose 1?
For instance, do we swim, then feef?
Brayden Haws
Body body in the pool
Merit Egan
Or do we just swim or feef
John Sherwood
Ya put some money down on us. There is a cash prize for the winner. "What's the prize?"-gay school of rock
Bryan Samuelson
"The top priiize!"
Tyson Amundsen
I'd feef and or body body
Im not convinced its a good.swim day. Cloudy, not too warm
Brayden Haws
Tyson is true, it's not warm. Though if it was raining a lot id swim, that'd be fun
Merit Egan
Hey, nothing would please me more than hours and hours of feef with lots of people
Merit Egan
Let's go buy Mucho Mangos in preparation
zach fackrell
At least 2 mangos a person
Brayden Haws
The green poops
So I'm at the fieldhouse and this Muslim guy just got arrested cause he wanted to workout but didn't have a pass and so he started freaking out and yelling about how they wouldn't let him in cause he wasn't Mormon
Merit Egan
#eyewitness
Brayden Haws
He was nuts
What time is feef?
Merit Egan
I say 8:30 sharp.

Merit Egan
Roll call. Me=1
Brayden Haws

zach fackrell

Bryan Samuelson

Merit Egan
Saw this at reams. Why is the black guy on team cocoa?
Brayden Haws
I'm all about that John Cena pic
But it's definitely a racist campaign merit
And if their stereotyping is true, John Cena is gay
We're getting sushi right now and our waiters name tag is: New Andy

Brayden Haws

TYSON!!!!!!!!!!
Sunday, June 29, 2014 10:34 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson what is the sub rule for temporary injuries?
Also, why did Netherlands sub so early?
Tyson Amundsen
Temporary injury? A sub is a sub, so its final when it happens. If someone leaves the field for treatment but is gonna return in a few minutes you just play a man down
I haven't seen the game yet, but I'm sure its a tactical sub at the half. Looked from highligts like Mexico dominated
John Sherwood
Breakfeast
A guy subbed in the 8th minute tzr. Cramps or something
Seth Vance
One of the announcers just said "Netherlands had something in them, and they squeezed it out.."
I too have something in me that I'm gonna squeeze out soon..
Brayden Haws
https://www.lds.org/prophets-and-apostles/june-first-presidency-statement?lang=eng
Did you guys see this?
Tyson Amundsen
Haws you know I saw it
also my dad said the Netherlands penalty at the end was bogus
Edward Ekstrom
It was
So gay, the ref ruined the game
Sunday, June 29, 2014 5:01 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Yayayayaya!!!
Tyson Amundsen
Dudes let's talk USA Tuesday. Huge game vs Belgium at 1 pm. Who is doing what that day? I'm presently scheduled to work, so I think I will watch at like 330
Brayden Haws
I have work all day, so I'll be watching here
Colby Condie
I work. I would be willing to watch in evening time. Radio silence. No phones. Record it
John Sherwood
I'd watch later in the day. 530
John Sherwood
I'm going to.be honest... I don't think we can watch it later and not find out who wins... nearly every one of us found out about the ghana game.
Bryan Samuelson
I made it through unscathed last time but I think it will be considerably harder this time. Knockout game, World Cup is in full swing, more people know/are excited
Merit Egan
Yeah, I'm gonna watch it live or on slight delay. No way a major delay will be feasible.
John Sherwood
Agreed. I may take a mega late lunch and watch at ESA... ir just on my iPhone
Brayden Haws
Though we will be separate, our spirits will be united
Bryan Samuelson
We'll use the navy seals signals.
This stands for unity circle, this means I'm switching my shirt inside out
Tyson Amundsen
Hahahaha excellent Bryan
Well anyone who wants to slight delay with me at 330 is welcome
Bryan Samuelson
If the fates are with me I might be able to teezer. I'm scheduled from 2 to 6 but if it's slow I could potentially be off much earlier

Jeff Knudsen
For anyone interested in watching it live with fans, apparently a huge group gets together and watches it inside Rio Tinto.
Tyson Amundsen
Good Bryan
I heard that was good jerfrey
Edward Ekstrom
I'll be watching at work. #paidToPoop
#myBossWatchesWithMe
#blessed
Tyson Amundsen
So that day no one discuss the game on the Google or true vox until 6 pm
Jared I expect you will be with me to watch it. Bryan I will do this so you can be with me
#prayingnopooping
Bryan Samuelson
#thankyouteezer
zach fackrell
ESA all the way!
Tyson Amundsen
Are they doing it again? I would've bet it was only cuz it was same day as the draft
zach fackrell
Oh yeah.. Hmm we'll have to check on that.
John Sherwood
They are. I think
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/76MbZIfxmkg
Why can't I have nice things?
Monday, June 30, 2014 11:41 AM
Bryan Samuelson
Jozy is cleared to play tomorrow!! Yayayaya
Colby Condie
Yesssss !
Merit in lieu of those racist Cocoa Pebbles... I found this gem. Why is the black power ranger the one in black clothes? And the Asian in yellow?

Edward Ekstrom

Bryan Samuelson
Fun fact Colb: we discussed that in one of my classes a few years back. And watched power rangers clips. College is awesome
Haha good Ed
Merit Egan
#racistrangers
USA just scored a sweet goal.
Oh wait, my fake spoilers need to wait until tomorrow
Seth Vance

Tyson Amundsen
Merit I will unfriend you if you do that
Brayden Haws
Any plans tonight x?
Merit Egan
Tyson, I formally apologize for my unethical joke about spoiling the USA match.
Haws, I could be convinced to party
zach fackrell
Drive in movie. Transformers
9:30

I was on Tooele City's website today and saw this. #autostruggle

Brayden Haws
Zach it's possible for me but idk if the mrs will want to be out that late
Tyson Amundsen
Everyone would love Germany Algeria
Classic display of how to use triangle to pull the keeper
Brayden Haws
Has anyone seen cap'n America 2?
zach fackrell
Ya it's good
Brayden Haws
It's at the dollar show
#patriotic

#germany
Tyson Amundsen
I'll go Haws
Gay, algeria dang you guys
Merit Egan
Impressive
Tyson Amundsen
But it was WAY unconvincing
Brayden Haws
You gotta put those shots on frame
Merit Egan
I was only able to watch a bit. I saw Germany's 1st goal.
Brayden Haws
820 at sugarhouse, who would attend the show?
zach fackrell
120 minute was pretty cool
Brayden Haws
Are there night classes during summer semester?
That's hell on earth
Merit Egan

Via Tyson
Tyson Amundsen
Thank you merit. Remember, this is Germany's keeper
John Sherwood
What's he doing way out there?
Brayden Haws
Somebody wouldn't let go of triangle
Though merit I would like to see a few streaks up the line to the opposing box
Bryan Samuelson
Guys I'm going in to work at 7:30 tomorrow morning. Pray for me
Colby Condie
Oh gosh Bryan. I would just quit
Merit Egan
Haha a few streaks up that sideline would be perfect
Tyson Amundsen
Guys I'm soooo pumped for tomo
And some kid in my ward alerted me to an Asian website to get $20 USA player jerseys ayooo
Gotta check the quality
Brayden Haws
Ayooo, save me a piece of that corn
Colby Condie
Where??
Teez spit it out
Tyson Amundsen
I'm trying to assure their quality before spitting it out. It's good politics
Good journalism
I can't tell on my phone, I'm getting more deets from the guy who recommended
Aliexpress.com
Colby Condie
We can buy a thousand jerseys then sell them for profit. Like Todd Furness
Tyson Amundsen
I hear they are worth the price
Brayden Haws
Did he buy one from
There?
I feel like aliexpress is sketch sometimes. Essentially it's a hub for tons of vendors from Asia who sell knockoffs and replicas.
Tuesday, July 1, 2014 7:45 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Bsam is at work.
John Sherwood
I am at work as well
Tyson Amundsen
I am at work, counting sheep
Edward Ekstrom
I'm on my way, why do you have to be in so early John?
We're all just old men, working for the man
John Sherwood
8-5. And I rode fast today
Tyson Amundsen
645-245
Colby Condie
I'm getting ready for work. Puttin in hours
Tyson Amundsen
And i hate that I can't hit ESA
Edward Ekstrom
Oh you were early. Employee of the month
Brayden Haws
I ain't at work. Bullshi, no one tells me to work
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson you have the sickiest shifts on earth
Tyson Amundsen
I concur. And I've barely been working this month and somehow I didn't get USA day off #palmtoface
Edward Ekstrom
Sucks, I'm watching at work for sure. Can you watch the beginning at work?
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe. But if I do I will need to get somewhere to watch the rest of it, its a 20 min drive home from here. Risky
So I either watch a replay or do all of it alone and friendless in real time
Brayden Haws
Tyson remember though we are apart we are united
Edward Ekstrom
Cause I was in Arizona this week and I was wondering how you could ever do missionary work during the summer there
Haws*
Brayden Haws
Luckily I love the heat, but also it was still way too hot
Hell on earth wearing a shirt and tie in 115
Edward Ekstrom
Seriously
Brayden Haws
During lunch I would just strip to my underwear and sit in front of a fan
And summer just lasts 7 months there
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha I would do that in brazil too but it wasn't as hot, just humid.
Colby Condie
Ya Italy was way humid too. But not near as hot as Arizona temperatures
I slept with a fan blowing straight on me constantly
Tyson Amundsen
LA was neither humid nor hot, but I never need an excuse to only be in my g's
Colby Condie
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Tyson would have a Mexican fanning him all night.
Brayden Haws
We'd put the bottom
Of our sheets over the fan so we could just sleep in a cool wind tunnel
Edward Ekstrom
It only cost two pesos
Tyson Amundsen
Haha. And then for excercise we would walk to a donut shop close by and get breakfast
Or occasionally fried chicken when my comp was cool
Colby Condie

Anyone need an Argentina Switzerland update?
With objective analysis
Bryan Samuelson
Yes
Merit Egan
Yes
Tyson Amundsen
0-0 80th minute
Even first half, now argentina dominating possession and Messi looking dangerous. Swiss could steal one
More and more looking like Argentina finish it. 85'
Dirtiest ratail of the world cup goes to Palacio of Argentina. Unreal
Incredible dribble from Messi, teammates blow it
Extra time! That's good for us. They will be more tired in the quarters
Whoever advances
Bryan Samuelson

I just sat down to watch, on a 2 hour break from work. God bless America
Edward Ekstrom
2 hours to game time.
Bryan Samuelson

Edward Ekstrom
Ayooooooo
Merit Egan
Anyone watching this current game, I want a prediction. Do we get a winner in the 2nd overtime?
Bryan Samuelson
Hmmmmm. Yes
Edward Ekstrom
still 0 0
105'
Tyson Amundsen
I am back! Still no winner 116'
This looks like penalties.
Let's do this Switzerland!
#upsetcity
Bryan don't start usa
John Sherwood
Tina
Bryan Samuelson
Wow
"At moments like that, you wonder if a higher power is at work" haha
Edward Ekstrom
last chance for suiza to tie it.
Tyson Amundsen
That was absolutely incredible
!!!
Goal in the 118th, then swiss off the post and free kick at the death to win it
Yet missed
Holy intense
Bryan Samuelson
For serious. If the US game is is anything like that I will probably die of a heart attack

Bryan Samuelson
No Becks in the starting lineup. It's fine
It's fine
Merit Egan
that is not fine
Brayden Haws
I mean he has the highest pass percentage on the team
But we don't need that
Wanna give Belgium a chance
John Sherwood
What the? Why?? Who instead?
Bryan Samuelson

Merit Egan
It looks like Cameron swooped in? have we learned nothing?
John Sherwood
Crap. That's not cool
Bryan Samuelson
He's just saving Beckerman for fresh legs and a goal in extra time
Tyson Amundsen
I'm baffled.
John Sherwood
Exactly. And I guess beck is on a yellow. I dint like it at all though
Tyson Amundsen
Gonzo played great last game, so I assume he wanted him and cameron both in
But you shouldn't exclude kyle
Ever
He and altidore better be late
Merit Egan
My confidence just took a 50 point hit
Good thing it was at 123,000, so 50 isn't too much
But had I learned that Beck was starting... it would have been 236,000. So there is a real opportunity cost here.
Bryan Samuelson
My confidence is directly proportional to the patriarch's confidence, so I still feel pretty good too
Tyson Amundsen
My heart hurts, but klinsmann has done.welll so far p

The worst part is looking back at Wondo's huge miss right at the end of regulation...
Should have put it in
Brayden Haws
Eddy this guy at my work has the new year model of your range rover. 700 horsepower
Tyson Amundsen
I am holding to the thought that the commentators said he was flagged for offside. He clearly wasn't, but I'll feel better if they were gonna call it back regardless
John Sherwood
If that's an mls game wondo puts that one in 9/10
Brayden Haws
Tyson we chalked the miss up to his hair. He has bad long hair
Merit Egan
The commentators said right after that the flag wasn't raised. The ref was just signaling goal kick.
Tyson Amundsen
I won't believe you merit. I can't
I like his hair
And most everything about the US
Brayden Haws
Most long soccer hair is cool, but not his
Idk why it's just not
John Sherwood
It wasn't offsides tzr. Wondo missed.
Merit Egan
He was onside by yards, plural.
John Sherwood

Merit Egan


Darke did indeed say the flag was not up for offside.
Tyson requested those be posted
Brayden Haws
Merit I wish my phone was as cool as yours so I had things to post
I'm just sitting here looking like a dick cause I can't draw on my screen

Guys, thanks for doing for me what I couldn't do for myself by posting those
So many good tweets and comments.
Obviously not offaide. But I'm going to believe that the flag was up for offside, whether hat was what it signaled I don't care
Don't rob me of my coping mechanisms
Brayden Haws
That flag is your catharsis
Tyson Amundsen
Finally, I loved that run sooo much. And I love all the players and klinsmann and all of you. What a freaking game man
I'll be talking bout hay for years

Fun fact. I entered the MTC exactly 5 years ago.

Edward Ekstrom
that was a long time ago.
that means I entered the MTC 5 years and 1 month ago.
Merit Egan
And that means I entered the MTC 5 years and 10 months ago
Colby Condie
And that means I entered the MTC 5 years and 3 months ago
Merit Egan
5 years, 9 months and 29 days. since I went in on the 3rd
Brayden Haws
I as well too also went to the MTC at some point
Merit Egan

That means I became a registered hermit 5 years ago. Benefits were great. Shi* living
Brayden Haws
Haha John
Merit Egan
haha registered hermit
photoshopping himself into pictures of us
Colby Condie
And a proud owner of a VW driver
Merit Egan
John owned a VW driver?
like as a slave? or a butler?
Colby Condie
Haha mistyped that one
Brayden Haws
I mean he said the benefits were good
But I didn't know that meant butler good
Colby Condie
Yes he was a Mexican slave. For free
Merit Egan
haha
John promised him that he would have a place to live, so long as he drove him everywhere he needed
John Sherwood
The government raises taxes to pay for the registered hermits butlers. Absurd.

This is the most active vox before 9:30am
In the history of time
John Sherwood

zach fackrell
I should pull double allnighters more often

Brayden Haws
Who has work today? I don't, idk why I'm alive
zach fackrell
Bells #livetweet
Edward Ekstrom
NIce!
what a view
Brayden Haws
What a butte
Edward Ekstrom
I'm at work
zach fackrell
It's lookin real nice
Edward Ekstrom
Haws why don't you have work today?
Brayden Haws
Cause I'm blessed I only work 3 days a week cause I work twelves
Edward Ekstrom
Oh jeez
Brayden Haws
So I do tues and thurs all day and then 6 hours one other day
Merit Egan
That sounds real nice as I'm sitting in the office today.
2 hours into a 12, I may feel differently, but it sounds real nice right now
Brayden Haws
The work days suck and are so boring but the leisure days are great
John Sherwood
Live from work. Riveting stuff
Brayden Haws
John do you just study there all day currently? Until you are certified?
John Sherwood
Mostly. We have team building exercises that we do everyday and they are way dumb. I suggested trust falls. They didn't bite
But yes I'm just studying my patoot off right now
I may not have a patoot next time I see you guys
Merit Egan
Without a patoot, John's athletic career would be over. Never again could he compete in Spikeball Tournaments.
John Sherwood
I have a hefty insurance policy on that thing though. I'll be a thousand-airre
Merit Egan
Hallelujah
Brayden Haws
Fuh, wish I had Isis
Did you guys see the cavs are looking to offer Gman the max?
Merit Egan
I saw that they are going to give him an offer, is it for sure max?
Brayden Haws
That's what espn just said
Merit Egan
fuh
I just don't want to have to match a max deal. I want to match a $12M deal, not $15M
Brayden Haws
Yeah exactly. I don't think he's worth that much
Merit Egan
Yeah, same here. I do want to match it though, either way. This year is a wash anyway, and it would only be a 4 year deal.
Brayden Haws
I think Cleveland knows they're not getting lebron this year so they want to get a other good piece like gordon and hope that lebron on re-ups for a year with Miami and they try again next year
Merit Egan
If we don't match it, we will just have to bring in a veteran that is being way overpaid, like richard jefferson again
Brayden Haws
Yeah I think we have to resign gordon no matter what. I think there's gonna be a ton of huge contracts because people are all realizing getting lebron is unrealistic so they have money to burn
Merit Egan
yeah for sure. Cavs should freaking go after Greg Monroe
get a big. You already have 2 backcourt players that were #1 picks
Brayden Haws
Yeah Idk, they're like the worst run franchise
Merit Egan
yeah, that bennet pick was so bad
But, nobody else has really ended up any better
Brayden Haws
Just drove past the google street view car
Look for me on 21st south
Brayden Haws
What's everyone doing for the 4th?
And tonight for that matter
Merit Egan
everything imaginable
Tyson Amundsen
I'm very sad that I missed the Great Live Vox of 9:30 a.m.
Alex Crawford
We are doing Sugarhouse park. Do any of you guys go to that show?
Colby Condie
Minnick family is going to stadium of fire. So I'm attending with them
Merit Egan

http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/07/02/stat-attack-klinsmann-benched-beckerman-against-belgium-for-a-reason-and-it-backfired/
Tyson shared this. Explains why Beckerman sat.
Tyson Amundsen
Or does it.... Basically Cameron was supposed to handle Fellaini (black Afro) in the middle, which he did well. But no one can pass like Kyle, and the US were worse in possession than John Candy was in dieting
Merit Egan
That picture shows Kyle's passing supremacy.
Tyson, I agree. It doesn't explain it. It tries to explain what his strategy was, but it didn't work
Tyson Amundsen
The actual possession stats were closer than it felt like, it wasn't far from 50/50 in regulation. But it sure didn't feel like it cuz they knew what to do with it and we didn't
We need Javi Morales for team USA
Merit Egan
haha yeah.
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, we're going to Annie's cabin this weekend because the biggest firework show in AZ is in the town where you guys stayed.
Merit Egan
We would pass it around a few times, then turn it over, and they would immediately run it down and get a SOG
Edward Ekstrom
And I invited you but you said you couldn't
Brayden Haws
Eddy I remember this now, which is causing me a great fear that kasey is making me do something this weekend that I don't want to do but I can't remember what
Merit Egan
haha
Brayden Haws
Merit you know the feeling. When your wife has plans but you don't remember them but you know they aren't fun
Merit Egan
haha oh yeah. Last friday I had to go to a BBQ with her old coworkers. Just terrible
Brayden Haws
4yrs, 63 mil
Merit Egan
A cleveland sports insider says the max offer is "wildly exaggerated"
Brayden Haws
I'd be glad if that is true
Colby Condie
Guys Brett Dennen is playing at USANA tomorrow night!
Brayden Haws
How did we not know?
Colby Condie
I don't know but I wanna go
Brayden Haws
So they really changed utah man?
Tyson Amundsen
Those homos
Brayden Haws
I hate the U
Tyson Amundsen
Zach lets swim?
zach fackrell
I'm at the crentist
Tyson Amundsen
When do you return
It's about a thousand out there
zach fackrell
Then I have to go to pleasant grove for a quick bit. I'll be back at like 6?
Brayden Haws
It's so hot. If we could swim,
I'd give you a hug Zach
Suit on or off you choose
zach fackrell
Haha I'll take it
Tyson Amundsen
I'm likely going to a bbq in the land bountiful at 7ish, swim then come with
Colby Condie
Tyson bust out the American speedo
zach fackrell
Oh, that would make a nice place to fish. I like fishing, but I'm not a very good fisherman. I always throw the fish back into the water, just put a band-aid on his mouth, tap 'im on the patootie and let him on his way. And maybe some day, if I'm lucky, I'll get to catch him again.

-Bob Ross
John Sherwood
Second "patoot" reference today
Colby Condie

Minni is my patootie
John Sherwood
Haha a good compliment to any female
Merit Egan
My butt is my patootie
and kelli is my patootie
John Sherwood
Your butt is kelli. Math
Edward Ekstrom
Cutie patootie
Merit Egan
We just proved the transitive property wrong
Edward Ekstrom
the relationship is many to one
so it's not commutative.
one to many*
Merit Egan
Did you guys see the chaos in the streets after USA lost yesterday?
Colby Condie
In salt lake?
Merit Egan
#toosoon
Merit Egan
Tyson I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I can feel true anger from Tyson
Brayden Haws
Do we think diante still makes the team?
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Haha Haws yes
Merit I'm not mad at you
Jared I am at you cuz you never Google vox and you have no reason not to
Jared Carter
What you can type on this?
A la patootie why didn't anyone tell me
John Sherwood
Who's the small testes guy? Dick cheney?
Brayden Haws
Perishing, pres of the U
John Sherwood
That's right. Small testes dick cheney perishing
Brayden Haws
Haha
Thursday, July 3, 2014 7:48 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Alright Tyson, if Beckerman had played, did we win that game?
Tyson Amundsen
Impossible to say for sure of course. Maybe not. But I definitely think he would've given us the best chance
And I would say for sure Tim Howard wouldn't have had to make 16 saves. No way
Edward Ekstrom
I think we would have won for sure. Kyle doesn't lose.
Merit Egan
Kyle has never lost in a knockout round
Tyson Amundsen
Exactly
Merit Egan
#undefeated
Seth Vance
Who knows how to repair canoes?

Tyson?
Should I try to get one of these?
Brayden Haws
Put some pine tar on that
Seth Vance
I told them I'm interested. Just in case.. They might all already be spoken for.
I would sure love to have a canoe.
Brayden Haws
I feel like you can but a patch kit that is like tons if mesh patches that you then glue over and layer til the hole is fixed
Duct tape might work too
Merit Egan
What about that rubber spray infomercial? He uses it to fix boats
Alex Crawford
Seth by one. I'll help you fiberglass it back together. You just buy a pre epoxied patch. My family's boat used to have like a 10 foot wide hole in the side and we fixed it up great.
How much are they?
Buy*
75!? Get me one too!
Bryan Samuelson
https://twitter.com/djjazzyjody/status/484756056027848704
We love you Jeremy Evans
Tyson Amundsen
Seth, Alex- if you guys are buying get me the third
We'll all have one and repair them juntos
Seth examine how bad the damage is. And how big is the canoe? I'm hoping 17' minimum
I really don't know how good a bargain that is
But I'll trust your judgement Crawdad
Canoes man, yes
Brayden Haws
Guys who would wanna go camping on the 18-19th? Me and kasey j will plan everything, we just need to know who to plan for
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah man, I should like that very much
Brayden Haws
We need al, to fly in for this one
Colby Condie
Haws I would love that. I'll have to check my fiscal schedule
Brayden Haws
I'll get the Dutch ovens out, and the beer, we'll have a good ole time
Colby Condie
Camping bach party?
Jared Carter
Ayoo I love camping! I even have a two man sleeping bag.
They zip apart so I'll just be bringing one.
zach fackrell
Yes Colby. Yes
Yes haws
Guys I wanna camp
Brayden Haws
Jared bring that two man, we need to share body heat
Jared Carter
Okay packing list machete, gasoline propane tank and 50 bucks. And a two man sleeping bag. Yeah we're good.
Seth Vance
So, those canoes sell for $999 brand new! Holy I want one. Tyson, I'm not sure the length, but they're pretty big. And Alex, I may not even be able to get 1.. much less likely I snag dos. I'll do my best though.
Alex Crawford
Ok Seth, try as hard as you possibly can. Throw some 'bows if you need to.
Seth Vance
Haha okay.
Colby Condie
Yeah Seth. Use your strength. "Just give em the stunner." -Haws
Merit Egan
Camping...I could do that. Anyone partying tonight? Local firepit hangout? Teez, I could play some croquet.
Alex Crawford
Haws I also love camping but no can do. I have a journey to Cedar City that I must make.
Brayden Haws
It's also likely we will do it another weekends as per my wife
So the times, dates, places are flexible
And Seth if you can get a canoe get one
Alex Crawford
Any other weekend and Megan and I are game. We have mucho camping supples too that will facilitate an excellent gathering in the woods.
Seth Vance

There they are
Alex Crawford
Tyson has a portable john. That's very useful
Seth just grab 'em and leave the money on the floor.
Seth Vance
Haha that might just work.. Cold, hard cash.
They'll never know.
Alex Crawford
Cold hard we need all 3 canoes for haws camping trip. Justified.
Brayden Haws
We can play that game with the greased water melon in the lake
Seth Vance
I should've checked my email sooner. They gotta text me about stuff like this..
Ain't nobody got time to read emails
Haws I've never played that but it sounds great
Weren't we gonna play last year at causey Tyson?
Alex Crawford
The watermelon game is awesome.
Seth you need to get a smart phone for things like this.
Seth Vance
Someday..
Perhaps sooner than later
Breaks over. Time to get back to fixin bikes.
Tyson Amundsen
Seth get those canoes, all three.
Haws i cant that week, Seth and I are talking backpacking next weekend
Merit, I'm 2 hours from phoenix. Follow my trip story via my tweets
Alex, I've been itching to get out the porta-john for a while
And yeah man, watermelon game coming right up
Brayden Haws
Tyson man, I feel like you didn't disclose anything about your trip besides saying you were in cedar this morning
Like you never revealed you were going
Tyson Amundsen
Hmmm. Bryan knew at least, and I feel I mentioned it in the true vox
I'm the lifeblood of that thing
Brayden Haws
I feel Like you only mentioned it this morning, but either way you'll be missed
Both here and in the true vox
Tyson Amundsen
Seth, I'll bid $90 for my own canoe
Haws I haven't been super excited about being in phoenix in July, that may be why I haven't mentioned it
Let's talk about how deutschy Austin Bowyer has been
Brayden Haws
I wish I was there, just nestled in the womb of the son
Oh I bet way douche, haven't seen him lifting for weeks, I'm sure he's just insane right now
Tyson Amundsen
Just bugging me about doing research and MCAT scores and schools #ultimatewangman
Brayden Haws
Did he ever find any research
?
I really hope he doesn't get into a school because of that, deserves it for being so douchey
Tyson Amundsen
Idk, all I know is I told him I couldn't help him. And in all honesty you're completely right
I've been getting a bunch of secondary applications every day for the last week. Soon I will start on those
Brayden Haws
The ideal
Is you get accepted to a ton of schools and he gets into none and then you can give him a taste of his own medicine and keep pestering him about things that you obviously did better in
Tyson Amundsen
Sweet nectar
Bryan Samuelson
Merit, is anyone partying tonight? Jared and I are willing and able
zach fackrell
I'm headed to a pool party on foothill. Come party guys
Brayden Haws
Zach man, swimming in my tub isn't a pool party
zach fackrell
I'm across the street from your house man. Come stop by
Tyson Amundsen
I'll be there
zach fackrell
I see you Tyson.
I'm in the pool already
Merit Egan
I schwent to dinner. No party tonight. We cannot party without teezer.
Brayden Haws
Except tomo when we party without him
Tyson Amundsen
You're right Merit, I thank you
Youre right Haws, I appreciate you
Brayden Haws
I mean we'll party but it won't feel the same without you Teezr
Tyson Amundsen
Holy gosh, I love phoenix
Just hit up a taco truck with my brother. Al pastor, cabeza, asada...
Edward Ekstrom
Just got to Annie's cabin. About to take a cabin poop
Colby Condie
The best poops
Friday, July 4, 2014 11:43 AM
Colby Condie
July 4 swim?
Jared Carter
swim white trash style? I'll get the truck bed filled up.
Colby Condie
Yes Jared
Tyson Amundsen
It's cloudy and 88 degrees in phoenix. There is a God
Brayden Haws
Haha oh Teezr
Brayden Haws
What's everyone doing today?
Roll call
Bryan Samuelson
Probably just family time for me
Jared Carter
Im going to stadium of
Colby Condie
Dude me too Jared
Jared Carter
Ah yeah. I'll probably see you there.
Colby Condie
Jared get Carrie underwood's number
Jared Carter
I already have it. She's one of those ex girlfriends I never talk about. How can anyone date someone that says y'all forty three times in one day. That was out last day together.
John Sherwood
Jazz got Steve novak. Ah yea. shooters gonna shoot. We lost diante garrett though
Bryan Samuelson
I liked Diante. But that's great for us
Merit Egan
I like the trade. I don't like it if we don't really want Novak since there are 2 years left on his deal, but I think he's a good piece.
Bryan Samuelson
I think we want him. We need shooters. And it's honestly not a bad price
Merit Egan
Yeah, is it 2 years 3.5 a year?
Bryan Samuelson
Mmhmm. 3.6 I believe
Merit Egan
Ok that makes it a much better deal. When I first read the article it said 2 years 7 million, but now I realize that is the total.
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah that's what I thought too, but I feel much better with 7 over two years
zach fackrell
I just got home. Come swim!!!!


Brayden Haws
Zach what was the name of the abc song
Tyson Amundsen
Oh now don't start that again! #junglebookvultures

Edward Ekstrom
Pooping*
Haha Haws
Merit Egan
Teezer, break down the Neymar injury.
Eddy, with your Brazil connections you can break it down too
Tyson Amundsen
I'm not mad at Colombia. Live and on replay it didn't look like it had excessive force to me, although perhaps clumsy
I also was surprised how bad it was. Didn't look it to me
What ppl have been saying that I agree with is that the whole thing was poorly officiated. Since the ref didn't have control, something was bound to happen
Merit Egan
I only saw like a 4 second replay and knew nothing about the game. I just heard there were a few hard challenges on Neymar so I wondered if there was more to it.
Tyson Amundsen
Lots of fouls on both teams
Lots of fouls on James Rodriguez too, Colombia's best player. I'm not sure I can say there was really targeting. It was just a rough game
Too much diving
Merit Egan
Cool cool. Unfortunate for Brazil.
Brayden Haws
I was at work and heard it playing but didn't see, but from what twitter was saying, I didn't see too many people saying it was dirty
http://youtu.be/TsVcMqgQdJo
Extreme sitting? Idk how this became real
Brayden Haws
Just ran into Spangler at the fieldhouse, idk how he is lifting with one hand
Brayden Haws
I'd swim
Today
Just talking to myself
Here
Tyson Amundsen
Haha nice man
0-0 at the half Costa Rica Netherlands
Incredible for the Ticos
Brayden Haws
I've been watching it, I hope they win the cup
Tyson Amundsen
Sorry Zach, but we all want to see Costa Rica win
They continue to defy all logic and expectations
zach fackrell
The Dutch have to win!
Brayden Haws
Screw the Dutch man. Screw their period
zach fackrell
Bite your d*mn tongue
Brayden Haws
Stop the ship
Tyson Amundsen
Ahab you son of a bi!
Bryan Samuelson
Van pers is on auto struggle
Tyson Amundsen
How did he miss???
Vamos Ticos, this would be a miracle
Brayden Haws
4 mins, god help them
Tyson Amundsen
Meanwhile, have you noticed how good Costa Rica is at holding an offside line? Sheesh
Bryan Samuelson
Very impressive. I maintain that that has to be the riskiest/most stressful strategy in sports
Holy shiiiiiiii
Brayden Haws
Gosh all mighty
Bryan Samuelson
There are angels in front of that goal
Brayden Haws
Angels in Goal, coming this fall to Disney Channel
Bryan Samuelson
I'd watch it, no doubt in my mind
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha oh my gosh
I think my stream is like two mins behind you guys
I felt buzzing.before it happened
I may just mute it and join in later
After anything happens
Bryan Samuelson

Bahehehe
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha yes
Tyson Amundsen
Everyone tune in! This is required watching
Bryan Samuelson
This is madness
Brayden Haws
I'm gonna shiz myself
Tyson Amundsen
Aaaaaaaaa

Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson

"Aaayyyyeeee Rigatoni" -Eddy
Brayden Haws
Guys did anyone even hangout this weekend?
Cause I sure as hell didn't, but I sure as hell wanted to
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan's thinking it, so I'll say it: Haws is getting a little loose with his language lately haha
Bryan Samuelson
Haha it's fine Haws, I'm not even mad. But yeah I feel like no one really hung out. Jared and I hung out, is that it? What's happening to our hood?
Brayden Haws
Tyson thank you for the censure, it's needed. It's all my wife's fault she's a bad influence always swearing, but I can't blame her she's from West Jordan, they don't have morals there
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Brayden Haws
But on the other hand Heber C Kimball swore all the time and he turned out fine
Colby Condie
Who was the apostle in the early 1900s that said hell and damn at in general conference all the time?
Brayden Haws
That's him, Heber kimball
Tyson Amundsen
False
Brayden Haws
Haha just kidding
Tyson Amundsen
J Golden Kimball
Brayden Haws
J golden
Tyson Amundsen
Get it right man
Brayden Haws
Freak me
I've been so dumb lately
This is the Olympic torch all over again
Tyson Amundsen
Haha just lol'ed there
Brayden Haws
I need to eat some vegetables or something, my brain is dying
Brayden Haws changed the topic to Haws is the dumbest person in the google vox
Tyson Amundsen
Zach, I shouldn't be finding out from #SchumannTweets what you are up
to
I'd like a rundown on your past 48 hours, and your next 24
Tyson Amundsen changed the topic to Where in the world is CarmenZach Diego
Brayden Haws
I knew Zach was going there
He told me last Saturday
Tyson Amundsen
I liked you better when you were swearing Haws
No one likes a know it all
How come i didnt know? I'd still like a 48 hour play by play
Brayden Haws
I'm sorry mr perfect, I forgot you never made a mistake

Colby Condie
Dumb and dumber
I know that movie back and front
Brayden Haws
Colb be careful what you say about knowing stuff, Tyson will kill you for it
Colby Condie
Tyson I am perfect
Merit Egan
This is what Teezer is up to in Arizona
Sunday, July 6, 2014 9:22 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, what is the Olympic torch sorry?
Story*
Brayden Haws
The other day I drove past the stadium and saw the Olympic torch and didn't know it had always been there
Edward Ekstrom
Haha no way
Brayden Haws
Yep, I've gotten real dumb this summer
So we got a new bishop last week, and he was just talking about nephi being reincarnated
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes
Brayden Haws
Like what do we even do, it's his job to correct false teaching over the pulpit and now he's doing it
Tyson Amundsen
What the? Like what did he say? Switch to the true vox, let's hear this
Brayden Haws
He kept saying how all these ancient prophets were reincarnated as people he has met in his life. Like he was trying to just make a point that good people now are like the ancient prophets but he was definitely not clear about that. Our neighbor is here with us and she just had no idea what was happening
Alex Platis
#MormonBuddhist
Tyson Amundsen
Well good missionary work to get your neighbor
Also if he was actually thinking his neighbors were reincarnated prophets I think you gotta say someyhing
Merit Egan
Live church vox. #jedfackrelltestimony
Brayden Haws
Really he was just trying to make a comparison but that didn't come thru til Kiel halfway thru his talk
Tyson Amundsen
Live vox from my brother's downtown phoenix ward- I feel like I'm on my mission again
All sorts of weird comments in gospel principles
Tyson Amundsen
Lots of Pakistanis. One named Asim, pronounced "awesome"
Used to be stake president of Pakistan. Like the entire country. Escaped persecution and ended up here
Colby Condie
Dude pause Tyson that Asim guy sounds "awesome". Make friends with him
Brayden Haws
Anyone looking for a Sunday evening activity?
Tyson Amundsen
Read a good book
Tyson Amundsen
Ok well if we aren't gonna discuss Sunday evening activities, I'll throw this out there
Friday the 11th to Sat the 12th Seth and I are gonna do a brief backpacking overnighter. Oh Come All Ye Faithful
Brayden Haws
Where to Tyson? Id love to go
Tyson Amundsen
We'd love to have you. The best part is we are thinking local, similar to that one time when I called Jed a douchebag for waking up Eddy
The upper bell canyon reservoir is one option. The other is lone peak, starting from corner canyon
Bryan Samuelson
I'd also love to go. And I'd like to hang out tonight Higgs but I don't know if I'll be available
Brayden Haws
Yeah I like that idea cause the worst part of backpacking is having to drive along way there or especially back when you'll all tired; might fall asleep on the free way
Tara's bros baptism is that Saturday but I bet I can get out of going as I don't even know him
Colby Condie
Up at the cabin
zach fackrell
Tara's bro is getting baptized??

Also yes let's do upper bells!!
I'm in
Tyson Amundsen
#Tmal
The idea was hatched by Nathan Brewster and myself, so lone peak is more likely since he has done bells
Nevertheless, there it is
Bryan we can search for the ladies of the mountains, like mermaids but from land
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
Who will seduce us
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good teezer
zach fackrell
Ayooo. Last night
Brayden Haws
Rock maids
They're even more randy than mermaids
zach fackrell
Jk I wish I was there. ..:(
That was from josh
That could've been us teez
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes Haws, rock maids
Zeez you werent there? #SchumannTweets said you were, which is why I wanted to hear from you
zach fackrell

Brayden Haws
Zach man don't hide from your friends
zach fackrell
Guys sometimes I just like going to concerts. I'm not running away
zach fackrell changed the topic to
zach fackrell changed the topic to System link needs to happen soon #halo
Tyson Amundsen
Zach, have you considered opening your location so eddy and merit can keep tabs on you?
We just want to be part of your life
And for you to be in ours
Secret isn't safe #badgandalf
zach fackrell
Haha yeah. But then Colby would just screenshot where I'm at.

Brayden Haws

Colby Condie
Haha what bothered you Zach
It's so "epic"
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen

Bryan Samuelson
I hope they don't streak during the game. That'd be nasty
Merit Egan
#stalking

Brayden Haws
This is why I don't share my location with merit, he'd see me at my house for hours and know I was having sex
Merit Egan
haha, yes. i just assume if anyone is at their house, they are for sure rollin in the hay
Colby Condie
Hahahaha
Yeah guys I'm assigned to work at Willow Creek today cashing checks
John Sherwood

Merit Egan

Merit Egan
On the corner of Main Street, just trying to keep it in line
Brayden Haws

Merit Egan

zach fackrell

Will
Idk?..
Merit Egan
Woulda Coulda Shoulda Willa Doa
Brayden Haws
I feel like John said he was back
Merit Egan
Ile eelfe ikele ohnje aidse ehe aswe ackbe as ellwe #piglatin
Colby Condie
Crawdad to answer your question bocce is just another word for "balls"
Not in the testicular form though
Merit Egan
So that game is balls ball?
Bocce Ball?
or is it just called Bocce, and we added a word cause we are dumb
Colby Condie
Correct. Americans named it that
Merit Egan
Sweet, so glad we only had to go to school from 8-3 for 3/4 of the year.
worth it
Alex Crawford
Thanks for that Colby. Do Italians even play bocce?
Colby Condie
Yeah. It's mostly old people though. It's pretty common to have bocce courts in the parks
Old people play it cause it requires zero physical effort besides tossing a ball
Merit Egan
I quite enjoy bocce
I might jump out in the car for a few minutes
Tyson Amundsen
Greeting from Kanab, UT
I like it here
Brayden Haws
So swim? Feef?
Colby Condie
I'd swim for sure
Brayden Haws

Brayden Haws
We wanna party with you. In the pool. On the pitch

Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson

Thus extending our swim now time
Brayden Haws

Bryan Samuelson
Valid option. I'm coming over now
zach fackrell
Come one come all we'll figure it out
Jared Carter

Brayden Haws

zach fackrell

Edward Ekstrom
Just took a pooh, wiped once, and my butt was clean. #blessed
Merit Egan
Woah... was it a wet wipe or the regular toilet paper? Also, have you used Nair lately?
Brayden Haws
Guys come over real quick, we invented a new game
Merit Egan
Does it involve movement?
Edward Ekstrom
Regular.. I'm in blanding Utah at Thatzza Pizza, no wet wipes..
Shout out from Blanding!
Brayden Haws

Tuesday, July 8, 2014 1:14 PM
Merit Egan
woah guys...I'm a little worried that everyone is constipated. There has been no singing of a morning poop song
Brayden Haws
Guys last night we discussed and planned at the pool that we are going camping aug 15-16, everyone please plan accordingly and attend
Tyson Amundsen
Merit put that in the calendar as the latest installment of the X banquet
I worry that john won't be able to come? Too close to wedding?
Brayden Haws
That's after johns wedding but before his honeymoon, we believe
Tyson Amundsen
And does that count as colby's erstwhile bachelor party?
These questions need answering Haws
Good answer
John Sherwood
I'll be up in midway during that junction
Brayden Haws
That's also after Colby's wedding. This is just a fun friend over nighter. We'll need more antics and outings prior to both colb and johns weddings
This is a camp that is for women folk also just a quick fun overnighter. For colbs we'll all just go into the woods with just a knife and see who can survive the night
Colby Condie
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Well when will that be
I realize that's after colb's wedding, but time is always at a premium
Colby Condie
I'm bringing a deer rifle and a tomahawk . I should be good
Tyson Amundsen
Meaning I bet we will be lucky to get us all together
My phone is lagging way bad #halo #SLS #systemlinksoon
Edward Ekstrom
Wives included?
Brayden Haws
Yes wives included
Bring ya wives, bring ya kids, cause we camping with everybody out there
John Sherwood
Pants on the ground, pants on the ground. Brazil is looking like a fool with their pants on the ground
Colby Condie
What the shi?! 4 goals in 6 minutes??
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, get back into halo and I can play with you
Tyson Amundsen
OH MY GOSH
Colby Condie
Germany up 5 at half.. Simply amazing. How is no one else talking about this??
Tyson Amundsen
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY COLBY THAT'S WHY
If I was Brazilian, there's
A very good chance I would kill myself
Colby Condie
I'm more shocked with the 4 goals in 6 minutes than anything else
That's like back to back to back to back
That's like us playing Feef
Merit Egan
just watched the highlights. A massacre!!!!!
John Sherwood
Let's play tennis tonight?
Edward Ekstrom
If by tennis you mean halo over xbox live, I'm in.
Merit Egan
If by tennis you mean tennis or fifa, I'm a maybe
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy is right. It should be halo
Edward Ekstrom

just got an ipad air from my work.
I want to use it as my phone.
#evenBiggerThanANote
Halo tonight.
what time?
Tuesday, July 8, 2014 7:59 PM
Tyson Amundsen
I realize everyone swam last night, but I would swim tonight. It's freaking hot
Brayden Haws
I'd swim, I'm ready in 45
Bryan Samuelson

Guys I know I'm hours and hours late, but this is funny
Tyson Amundsen
I haven't even caught the tweets man, I can't wait to see them
Brayden Haws
Gman
Bryan Samuelson
Charlotte, you idiots. Gosh dangit
Wednesday, July 9, 2014 10:11 AM
Merit Egan
I know right. Just force us into a max deal
leave it to Michael Jordan to do a retarded GM move
Brayden Haws
Merit do you think with now having hood we should match? I think we will, but should we?
Merit Egan
I think it's probably best to match.
Hayward is good, if he gets his shooting % closer to 50%, he'll average 20 pts a game
Bryan Samuelson
I feel like it's damned if you do, damned if you don't
Merit Egan
Plus, Exum wouldn't be due a big contract until this one is up
A lot will depend on how much we have to pay Kanter and Burks. We don't want to overpay 3 players, and with Hayward we are overpaying 1 now. The other 2 deals will be signed this summer.
I think we got a good deal with Favors
Brayden Haws
Yeah I agree, I think basically we're not gonna attract a big time player so we need to keep good players we have even if we have to overpay for them
Right now it scares me, but what a lot of people have said that with the new tv deal the cap is gonna rise so much that soon Gordon's deal with be like an average salary, not a Mac
Max
Merit Egan
Mostly, Tyrone Corbin kinda screwed us in terms of knowing what we have.
1. Hayward put up numbers, but poor efficiency in a bad system, so there is still a question of how good he is.
2.He didn't play Kanter enough, so now we have to guess his value.
3. Burks should have taken a butt load of minutes from Richard Jefferson, so now I think it will take more to keep him because he hasn't particularly liked how the Jazz have handled him.
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's how I feel too,we have a lot of pieces but we really don't know how valuable they are and what they can do
Merit Egan
yeah. and a 4 yr, 15M per year salary probably won't come back and bite us
this year is a waste anyway, so then we are just looking at 3 years.
If we didn't resign him, we will have to spend $15M this year on like Antoinne Walker or something
Brayden Haws
Haha Antoine Walker
Merit Egan
Somebody said it during the draft about the 76ers or something, but there comes a time when you need to stop with rebuilding / asset accumulation and start taking steps forward. The Jazz have either used several top 5 picks correctly and we'll have a contender in 3 years, or we've shizzed a brick all over the place and we'll be rebuilding again in 3 yeras.
Kanter, Favors, Exum are all top 5 picks
Hayward, Burks, Burke, are all lottery picks.  That should be enough to get it done
Wednesday, July 9, 2014 2:18 PM
Colby Condie
Bring back Ostertag. It's the only way
Colby Condie
http://www.funnyordie.com/articles/94ea39d871/chris-bosh-and-lebron-james-text-discussion-about-their-next-moves
Haha
Brayden Haws
Good Colby
Anyone doing anything tonight? Let's have a toss or spikeball?
John Sherwood
Possibly go to the avett brothers up the hill behind red butte??
Brayden Haws
Didn't they ban that now? But I would enjoy that
Edward Ekstrom
How do you get tickets?
Brayden Haws
It's sold out. They offer em to members first and a ton of the concerts got bought out by them this year
Edward Ekstrom
Members of what?
Brayden Haws
Red butte garden
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it.  So if we went could we get tickets?
Brayden Haws
They get em for cheaper and get to buy them before the public
Well you can climb the hill behind the amphitheater and listen from outside red butte but I thought they had fenced the hill off now
Edward Ekstrom
Oh got it.
John, we will come if it is possible.
Colby Condie
Matisyahu plays this Saturday
John Sherwood
That's ridiculous if they fence that off.. I'll ask ju. She'll know
Edward Ekstrom
John.
Okay, we want to go.
Brayden Haws
Yeah ask her for sure, but I'm pretty sure it was on ksl that they had "for fire safety"
John Sherwood
Bullcr*p
Where is matisyahu colb?
She said they might've put a femce that obstructs view but I think we'll go listen anyway. Anyone everyone is welcome
Edward Ekstrom
We're coming.
Where should we meet?
Colby Condie
John the matisyahu concert is at Liberty Park
Brayden Haws
John let me know when you guys go, we'd come over, if it's possible to
John Sherwood
Ya let's all go. we have some fiscals at 730. I can call once we're done. We'll be riding our bikes too
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Oh she would for sure
Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen

Seth Vance

Jeff canoe son
They freakin let the people in the office have em! Not fair. I tried my darnedest I tell you...
Offered cash money, women, first born child... All if it. They're just idiots.
zach fackrell
Well that was a let down #spidermanpoo
Thursday, July 10, 2014 8:39 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Spider-Man sucked?
Merit Egan
Seth just selling off slave women. Perfect.
Seth Vance
Haha
Anything to get a canoe
Tyson Amundsen
You did the right thing deg
Merit Egan
Just to follow up on a former message, AK47 has opened the first hooters in Russia. It is up and running.
Brayden Haws
He probably banged em all. #yearlypass
Merit Egan
Haha, yeah does he get one night or one girl?
Brayden Haws
I think one night
Colby Condie
Hahaha AK
Colby Condie



Brayden Haws
We'll hoist you up soon enough Colby
Merit Egan
Bsam has had a full hand of butt in the last 2 pictures.
Also, I've barely helped.
Brayden Haws
Bryan's the new bum clutcher
Colby Condie
The thing I'm looking most forward to is my wedding hoist. Nothing else
Brayden Haws
Not even the seh is as good as the hoist
Merit Egan
The hoist is the best thing that has happened to me before, and since my wedding.
Fifa comes in a close 2nd.
Kelli comes in 3rd
The Google vox might actually take 3rd.
Bryan Samuelson
Haha I'm clearly above the bum in the Haws hoist. Clearly. The hoist is the moment we all dream of since we were young children
Merit Egan
Ok ok, you are just above the upper rim of the bum. You are cleared from the bum clutcher.

Tyson Amundsen
Haha this made me smile
Let's do a face down hoist for colby #weenclutch
John Sherwood
I'm doing the splits in my hoist
Brayden Haws
Someone's hand is on my butt though
You can see it clearly in that close up
John Sherwood
That's me. Ya for sure.
Bryan Samuelson
Haha John is just way hidden in Haws'
Brayden Haws
I like in mine how merit is barely touching me but is also flexing to show his strength
Even with just one finger he was able to hold me up
Merit Egan
Yeah guys, I feel like I did 95% of the work. I'm taking it easy for both john and colby.
Tyson Amundsen
Should we try to balance colb on our heads? No hands? #innovative #pac12
Brayden Haws
We'd need the neck strength of accadians
Which we have obviously built up thru hours of training playing feef and playing headers
Colby Condie
Hahaha Tyson the ween clutch
Merit Egan
Haws, I need a breakdown of this young child's take....

Brayden Haws
Haha see ya later
I mean he's pretty accurate generally. I for one have never gotten sick from it but I could imagine it happens
I do wish he would have included some sort of chart or diagram to help me understand what exactly is taking place
Tyson Amundsen
I for one am wondering who this kid was and how old at the time he wrote this
Like was this a 9 year old patriarch? I couldn't even spell sex when I was 9 so that's why merit is the patriarch
Brayden Haws
Tyson I never thought that maybe merit wrote this and is trying to catfish us
But that's brilliant by him if it's the case
Edward Ekstrom
Does anyone want to go on a hike later?
Merit Egan
HAHA no this is not me. It was just a funny picture.
zach fackrell
It's Jeds wedding dinner so I'm out of commission for tonight.. Also I hope you fools come to the reception tomorrow evening
You better come
Edward Ekstrom
Oh I'll come
Brayden Haws
I'll be there
Eddy how was the show last night?
Merit Egan
Rimando was at the concert. He intagrammed it
does instagrammed have 2 m's?
Edward Ekstrom
It was sweet Haws
Hike anyone?
It halo over Xbox live?
Or*
Brayden Haws
Zach where is the reception at? I forgot
Tyson Amundsen
Who among you wants to play tennis or slackline like now? Or soon
Pre dinner party
Edward Ekstrom
No halo?
Jared Carter
John where is your new job?
Colby Condie

Another Bryan injury. #chronic
Brayden Haws
One in a million shot
Rocky would be jealous of the Bryan
Jared Carter
What the freak! How did that happen?
Colby Condie
Head to head collision. Bryan for sure got the nastier injury
zach fackrell
Oh my freak!! Bryan!!
Are you for real man?
Looks crazy
Alex Platis
Tell people it was a bar fight
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/WWX0dQo1tag
Seth Vance
Looking good bry
Tyson Amundsen
Holy Bryan! That's great. I've been there, eye injuries = getting action
Maybe in your case
Those look like stitches?
But it can't be
Youre still at the court
Colby Condie
The best shot is a side view of his face
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah, no stitches. The cut actually isn't too big. Wayne-o said just ice it and I'll be ok
Colby Condie
Girls love to ice wounds for you
And kiss it better
Bryan Samuelson
Exactly Colb, that's what I need
Bryan Samuelson

Friday, July 11, 2014 11:07 AM
Bryan Samuelson
Woah. Lebron is going back to Cleveland
Merit Egan
Yeah, best move he could make. I still have some bitter feelings towards him, but it's cool.
Bryan Samuelson
I agree. Did you read the essay he wrote? Seems pretty sincere
Merit Egan
not yet
This does make for an interesting scenario for the jazz
John Sherwood
Post it here bsam. I want to read it
How so mert? With gtime?
Merit Egan
The cavs might want to dump some salary, and the jazz could absorb some.
also, the cavs wanted Gtime, maybe we do a sign and trade and take back dion waiters and some other shiz.
Bryan Samuelson
http://on.si.com/1refVaU
Merit Egan
rumors have it that they might trade wiggins for somebody big. Like Kevin Love.
But we could send kanter and hayward for wiggins
i dunno
jus tthinking out loud typing
John Sherwood
Whoa. So many possibilities
Merit Egan
I have no idea how the numbers would work. Hayward now has a big contract, so they might not want him and lebron
John Sherwood
Zach or anyone, where is the reception of jeds and what time? Who is going?
Merit Egan
I believe I'll be there. Party time after/before and during?
John Sherwood
Party time after and during for me. Not so much before. That could be subject to change though

Haws that last gif hits too close to home. Funny #xfriends
Brayden Haws
John I apologize I didn't connect the dots on that one. I was just trying to show how much Bryan was frustrating meQ
Brayden Haws
http://youtu.be/pGI3WW0c3kU
Haha just found this looking for YouTube clips for my moms bday
Colby Condie
Hahaha
I watched a full minute of it. Laughed
Brayden Haws
I just saw this chart that someone made showing who would start for every nba team if they were composed of only homegrown players (ie Lebron in Cleveland). They showed all the teams except the Jazz, apparently there isn't even 1 person from utah in the nba
Colby Condie
Interesting
I guess that Utah-based colleges have produced NBA players but not raised them
Brayden Haws
yeah exactly kids that went to college here have but not any raised her currently on a roster
Colby Condie
Soon that will change though. "With the first pick in the 2016 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz select Merit Egan from Sandy."
Brayden Haws
Chronic Terror will be an expansion team
then there will be a lot
Merit Egan
haha you guys
I woke up to 181 messages #latenightvox
I especially liked how haws was live voxing during 7xangos
Brayden Haws
gotta give the people what they want
John Sherwood
Cj wilcox is the only one now
Colby Condie
Did he play at Lone Peak?
Brayden Haws
PG
which i wasnt sure if he was born there but  he was, so this musta been made before the draft, but still they couldnt have made one
Bryan Samuelson
All time Utah homegrown nba team:
Cj Wilcox
Britton Johnsen
Shawn Bradley
Jeff Judkins
Travis Hansen

That's a juggernaut right there
Brayden Haws
Thank you Bryan
Gratis
Bryan Samuelson
I had to dig deep to find five possibles. Apparently we haven't really had a golden generation of nba players
Brayden Haws
Britton Johnson, I'll take that 10 times outta 10
Merit Egan
haha that is terrible. With all the children that have been born in Utah mormon families, how do we not have more?
Bryan Samuelson
I have a jazz jersey of his, it's awesome
Brayden Haws
You would think church ball would turn out more pros
Bryan Samuelson
I agree Mert. What good are all these churches with gyms if we're not churning out superstars?
Merit Egan
I mean, the churches helped Jimmer
almost as much as the prison
Colby Condie
Well in all their own minds, they are already superstars
Merit Egan
and his brother TJ

We have the 2nd most successful Durant in the NBA
Edward Ekstrom
haha
Merit Egan
Durrant
shiz
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good John. I wanted him on the list but didn't know if e was born here
Merit Egan
the most successful durrant
Edward Ekstrom
Have you guys seen the big year?
Hilarious.
Colby Condie
Is that the bird one?
John Sherwood
That's about birding right?
Colby Condie
Birdies right?
Golfing
John Sherwood
I liked it
Merit Egan
I hated Moonrise Kingdom
I did like "The Way Way Back"
Edward Ekstrom
yeah
birding
it is funny, I liked it.
Haws, funniest thing from last night was the King of the Hill video.
John Sherwood
I like moonrise
Brayden Haws
I watched that for like 5 minutes just loling
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I liked moonrise other than the 12 year old makeout scene.
I felt like pervs would go to that movie just for that scene.
John Sherwood
Can any xcerpt member come to the distribution center on fort union and help me pick some cool G's?
Comfort
Brayden Haws
When John?
Merit Egan
When art thou going?
John Sherwood
530
Edward Ekstrom
If you wait until tomorrow I can.
But if you go today I won't be mad
Colby Condie
John I can go today
Brayden Haws
I'm available and willing
Colby Condie
I was on call but didn't get called in
John Sherwood
Both of you.
Brayden Haws
We're in
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, I'm staying up there tomorrow through Sunday.
Anyone who is available to system link, plan on every day.
Colby Condie
At the gents retreat?
Edward Ekstrom
Probably at my mom's
but we can system link there nonetheless.
I will have two xboxes with 8 paddles on site all the time.
That's right, you heard me.  TWO XBOXEN W/ 8 PADDLES ON SITE.  24/7
That means there will be no setup time required.
Brayden Haws
Eddy I can't tomo but all weekend I am availiable me
Colby Condie
Haha 2 xboxes and 8 paddles on site AT ALL TIMES
Merit Egan
Will there be a 3rd Xbox?
Edward Ekstrom
I recon we can scramble one up.
Merit Egan
SWAT on lockout
is it lockout/.
?
Edward Ekstrom
yeah
the purple one
John Sherwood
I'll play Friday night and Saturday
Sat night
After draper days
Colby Condie
Temple then draper days john?
John Sherwood
Ya man. And farmer's market in the morning. Anyone is welcome
Brayden Haws
Zach we swimming tonight?
Merit Egan
The nba is considering doing a mid season tournament, similar to how soccer has a tournament during the season. I think that would be cool.
Colby Condie
would it be at the all star break?
Merit Egan
i don't know. I think it would be cool if it was spaced out like the CONCACAF or US Open Cup tournaments.
Like it spans across 2 or 3 months and there is a game here and there
Colby Condie
ah i see
Merit Egan
Every team should be in it. random draw, teams from the previous year final get a bye. 5 rounds
zach fackrell
Someone is supposed to fix the pool cover this afternoon so we should be able to swim later today. I'd say plan on swimming
And halo
Brayden Haws
Murderball
Would it just be nba teams mert? D-league? Europeans?
Merit Egan
I don't know. I'd be open for either.
They could say that all playoff teams qualify, giving us 16, then build it out to 32 from there.
Brayden Haws
It'd be cool to see, likely they'd just get destroyed but you might get the occasional upset. Like the open cup
Colby Condie
I think a world football game would be cool. USA vs. the world. Use our Super Bowl winning team or players from the Pro Bowl against a team from players all over the world
We'd probably still kill em
Tyson Amundsen
I'm back in. Swim tonight, halo tomorrow. This is looking nice
Seth Vance

A little rust on the Slacklining
*rusty
Colby Condie
Where the H is that
Seth Vance
Logan
First dam
Tyson Amundsen
Seth you butt munch
I invite you to all cool things and this is how I'm repaid
Seth Vance
Come do this with me man
Tyson Amundsen
That looks way righteous
Colby Condie
Seth we aren't in Logan man
Seth Vance
But you could be..
Brayden Haws
Nick Sabah was gonna pay saban 100m
Haha Texas was gonna pay him
Tyson Amundsen


Brayden Haws
Teezr?
Tyson Amundsen
Hello beautiful!
Colby Condie
That's sweet
Tyson Amundsen
All the way from New Orleans, China
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Gosh almighty
Tyson Amundsen
Definitely worth it. $23
Let's all get some
Merit Egan
shiz yeah, can you still buy them. Sign me up
Tyson Amundsen
Im gonna get like 3 more
Brayden Haws
What? Dood I'll buy 3
Tyson Amundsen
I'll bring it to the pool tonight for personal inspection
Merit Egan
Put me down for 1. I'll pay you back.
Tyson Amundsen
Good news man, great news
It's wrinkly since it came across the ocean. I'll try and wash it first
Merit Egan
Across Beringia, it came through glacial snow, the american jersey, 5,000 seconds ago
zach fackrell
What time are people coming over? I have to home teach and do a photo shoot.

Home teach:7
Photoshoot:9
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan is your companion. Cancel
Brayden Haws
Are you going hometeaching with Bryan?
Tyson Amundsen
In between?
Brayden Haws
We'll come at like 630
Merit Egan
I'll be there at 7 and 9
wait
9 to 7
Tyson Amundsen
Zach when can we be there?
We'll be there whenever we can, including whilst you are away if necessary
zach fackrell
I have to make sure the pool cover works let me check and get back to you
Brayden Haws
Zach mark gave me the keys before I'm sure he will again
Trusty Heezr
zach fackrell
Bryan let's just invite Luke to come swim and do home teaching at the pool
Genius
Brayden Haws
Who's luke? Sounds like he wants to swim and be our friend
Tyson Amundsen
Yes. And I will sell him a soccer jersey. If we all sell three jerseys, and those people all sell three jerseys...
John Sherwood
Nu skin :-)
Brayden Haws
Young living
Colby Condie
Xija
Merit Egan
If we set the price at $35 a pop, and we all sell 3, we make $12 on each one, total of $36. Then, those people all sell them for $40, keep $5, and we take our normal $12, for a total of $108
Colby Condie
Xango
Merit Egan
May I say, I recently saw a Redbox. Do you know what they charge for a 1 night rental?
$1.20
do you know what they used to charge? $1.00
Does anybody care to pay .20 more for a movie for 1 night? No
So Redbox nearly creates a monopoly, then ups their price by 20 cents, and adds 20% to their bottom line.
genius
That's the way a true monopoly works.
Tyson Amundsen
Wow. I never thought of this. I'd watch a redbox tonight
And I know Zach would
Merit Egan
Most people talk about a monopoly as undercutting all prices, driving competitors out of the market, then jacking up the prices.
Redbox only slightly rose the prices. Could any company now create a movie stand that could take away from Redbox shares? probably not, cause everyone is pleased with redbox
Innovative, Strategic, Genius
And that's a wrap on my business lesson for today. Stay tuned for my next one the next time I see something smart like that
Edward Ekstrom
Why don't they raise their price to 2$?
I bet they did major market research and found nobody would care of they had to pay 20 cents more.
But any more than that and people would start caring.
Merit Egan
Are Blurays $2 there now. That's probably about as high as they could push it without having Blockbuster or Amazon create a market to take away from theirs.
Edward Ekstrom
The next question is, why is it so much to rent on google play, Amazon, iTunes and such as?
Merit Egan
Would you rather have 70% of the market paying $1.20, or 30% of the market paying $2 and now have to compete with another company
Edward Ekstrom
They should charge a dollar and such as
Merit Egan
I agree ed
Edward Ekstrom
Put redbox out of business.
Merit Egan
That would be smart of them. Redbox will probably be out of business soon because of the digital world. They need to go more digital
Edward Ekstrom
The next real question is should I stop streaming all movies online for free?
Probably..
Merit Egan
haha, i download torrents illegally. Should I stop?
Edward Ekstrom
Or I'll go to hell
Merit Egan
probably..
but some of these PG13's have inappropriate things, so is it better to watch them without paying for them? I don't want to pay money to a movie that has inappropriate humor
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
zach fackrell
Wise
Guys the pool cover is still broken.. I'm not sure if we can swim.. I've gotta wait till my madre gets home. Standby
Colby Condie
Let's swim in a bathtub
Brayden Haws
We can open the cover. Muscles
Tyson Amundsen
Oh crap. The prayer of faith
Merit Egan
I've been praying for the last hour. Is it open?
zach fackrell
We no can swim
The cover is getting fixed tomorrow
Sorry team
Tyson Amundsen
Bootsy Barker Bites
Dang
Merit Egan
Well that really leaves us only 1 alternative
Brayden Haws
Feef
Merit Egan
#hawsknows
Brayden Haws
Id play
Brayden Haws
It wouldn't be a bad night to bowl
Edward Ekstrom
This is Eddy with a friendly reminder that tomorrow to Sunday there will be two xboxes with 8 controllers at my moms house 24/7.
It would be nice to have a third but 4v4 has never been bed
Brayden Haws
No one doing anything? Eff
Bryan Samuelson
I'd do something. Sure would
Tennis? It's nice outside
zach fackrell
This is Zach with a little reminder saying I'll be living at eddys moms house starting tomorrow.


Thank you
Merit Egan
Beckerman cleans up real nice. #espys
Brayden Haws
Rimando was just the shortest on the team
Brayden Haws
Guys lets do something
Bryan Samuelson
Aye
Brayden Haws
God bless Stuart Scott
Brayden Haws
Well no one hung out so now I'm gonna watch lone survivor, it's rated R. Sins on your heads not mine, I woulda rather done something wholesome.
Merit Egan
Haha
We just watched the way way back. Very good movie.
Thursday, July 17, 2014 8:18 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Is it? I'll have to watch if
Here's one of the two Xboxes that will be at my mom's house 24/7 for the next three days
Merit Egan
haha
zach fackrell
The way way back is good. Also lone survivor is good.
Different goods but both good.
Merit Egan
Lone survivor is a good movie, but I hate it because they put themselves in the worst situation. Like, they were making a choice and it was like, pick any choice you would like. These ones might get you out of here alive, these ones for sure will, this one definitely won't. And they chose the one that definitely wouldn't let them live.
zach fackrell
Did they really need to let them go? #Ethicaldilemma
Brayden Haws
Just kill em
Or at least tie em up
Merit Egan
There were just so many better choices, even if they were trying to be ethical. Like take them with you as you walk the way you want for an hour, then let them run back. Buys you a ton of time.
Edward Ekstrom
alright guys, what time are we convening tonight?
Merit Egan
Post 7:30
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
it indeed is too late for me. I have a phone call at 8am MST Friday morning. I need my thinking sleep.
Edward Ekstrom
Just a business man
Alright a question for the group
you guys have seen the kitchenette in the apartment at my dad's
How doable is that for everyday living?
for a year?
Brayden Haws
There's a stove?
Edward Ekstrom
yes
but no oven.
stove, dishwasher, microwave, fridge drawers.
Brayden Haws
Full size fridge?
Edward Ekstrom
no
Brayden Haws
I think the fridge would be the hardest
Edward Ekstrom
But annie and I have like 5 things in our fridge
so that's not hard for us
we eat out a lot
plus we will be able to eat out more without paying rent..
Brayden Haws
Oh yeah then I bet it's fine
zach fackrell
Ya definitely doable
Edward Ekstrom
I thought so, just wanted to make sure that the freeness wasn't making me blind.
Colby Condie
For sure doable.
Order Chinese every night because you have no rent
Edward Ekstrom
So we still only have me merit zach kev dj
5
We need 3 more
zach fackrell
I'll try to get josh and Jeremy to come.

"Sometimes when your friends play halo you they show up at your house and force you to play Zanzibar for 9 hours #tweet"
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Okay sweet
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah but then you showed him that I put his tweets in here and he got all butt hurt!
John Sherwood
He knows we put his tweets in here?
zach fackrell
Hahaha I was loling the other night when you posted his tweet and then I kept asking if he was gonna tweet about everything we were doing thus leading to his discovery of the group hangout.

Haha What'd he say?
Did he tweet you?
Colby Condie
This calls for a feud. #SchumannAgainstTeezr
Tyson Amundsen
Oh he tweeted me. It was passive aggressive, kinda like #humblebrag except #passiveaggressive
zach fackrell
Just found it. funny man
John Sherwood
Ha funny. #passivelybumhurt
Colby Condie
He sure was patootie hurt
Edward Ekstrom
Post it
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
Haha I just used your hashtag john
Loved it
zach fackrell

Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Twitter battle
Brayden Haws
Haha Tyson great tweet at Blake
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
Haha dude I reigned in my Schumann tweets, I had some real zingers for him but I decided to be friends
Thats why we need Al on twitter
I've tried to call Schumann to twitter repentence, but he would not
John Sherwood
Reign the schumann tweets on here. I want to read them
Tyson Amundsen
I usually send them to Haws, sometimes put them in here
With him around we don't need Zach to share his location here. Schumann's got it haha
Brayden Haws
I almost always post em cause they're almost always asinine
Edward Ekstrom
Does showman hate us all now?
John Sherwood
Ha that's a good one teez.
Edward Ekstrom
Schuman*
Merit Egan
Should I follow Schumann now? He'd get paranoid.
zach fackrell
Hahaha he knows we poke fun at his tweets but he's used to it cause he gets crap from everyone.
He like the twitter battles
Edward Ekstrom
Got it.
Merit Egan
Due to the lack of enthusiasm regarding Halo, I'm gonna have to withdraw tonight. That way I can keep Friday and saturday open for play.
zach fackrell
Ohhhh myyyyyyy
Edward Ekstrom
Goodness.
Merit Egan
Woah, woah, woah. I feel like I'm taking the heat here. This is only because everyone else has dropped out, and I can't dedicate a night to subpar halo sessions.
Colby Condie
I suck at Halo so I will only attend if we find someone at my skill level who I can hopefully kill
zach fackrell

Almost playing halo
Merit Egan
Halo trust fall
Colby Condie
Haha

While everyone is posting GIFs....
Tyson Amundsen
Merit you Indian giver- play halo tonight
Merit Egan
I will if you will
Tyson Amundsen
I never withdrew
Merit Egan
I withdraw to provide more glory later. Sacrifice the lower law to live the higher law
This way, I can play both Friday and Saturday night. It is unlikely that I could get Kelli, or my other 3 wives, to allow me to play 3 nights in a row.
zach fackrell
I can only play tonight

Edward Ekstrom
I'm sorry Zach. We can just super jump around like old times.
But not really, because if were not playing I'll have family time.
zach fackrell

Edward Ekstrom
Wow, what happened to us?
In high school we would play Halo any day of the week.

Edward Ekstrom
Any hour of the day.

Edward Ekstrom
Guys, I had a 4 hour meeting yesterday and have another today.
I was seriously ready to kick the guy running it in the balls by the end.
Bryan Samuelson
Meetings are the worst. Anything over and hour is just killing brain cells
Edward Ekstrom
So true.
Bryan, give an honest estimate of when you'll be done with your date.
10?
10:30

Also Haws. There's only one Haws
Brayden Haws
That's exactly how I meant Tyson
They look the same, but not the same
Edward Ekstrom
What's the hardest time of the week to work.
?
Fridays from 12 - 5
no doubt in my mind.
I should pull a Kelli and watch a TV show.
Merit Egan
I'm a Tuesday person. Monday's suck and then the next day is still so far from the weekend.
Edward Ekstrom
Except they can fire me.
Merit Egan
Haha, just watch 5 seasons of friends in 2 weeks
Edward Ekstrom
They can't fire Kelli because it would be sexual harassment.
Merit Egan
Friday's after lunch do suck, the you just know so much happiness is about to come, that you can manage it.
Edward Ekstrom
Women can to whatever they want in the workplace because if anything happens to them, it's sexual harassment.
Merit Egan
Yeah, they could even rape somebody, and they would never be charged. The man they raped would go to prison.
Edward Ekstrom
yup
I'm just so freakin excited.
Merit Egan changed the topic to Halo Fest 2014

Have you guys seen that?
Brayden Haws
Guys I don't even work on Fridays, that's the way to do it
Edward Ekstrom
Lucky
I'm mid 4 hour meeting. I'm definitely going to fall asleep.
Brayden Haws
We can also get Collin to play tonight if we want more
He also has an xbox but no halo
Merit Egan
Guys I'm a late scratch. Just broke my thumb.

Bryan Samuelson
Merit?
Don't tease us
Brayden Haws
Merit if you've done this...
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Merit how did it happen?
Bryan Samuelson
Oh heck. Merit I get hurt so you don't have to
Who has done this thing? More Funfective sabotage? A freak business call accident?
Colby Condie
What the h?!
Merit Egan
I slammed my finger in the phone
Guys I'm ok. As bsam said, he gets hurt so we don't have to. #selfless
Also, my earlier pics were of opposite hands on accident
Brayden Haws
Merit if you just lied to me I'm gonna kill you so many times tonight
Unless we're on the same team
Edward Ekstrom
Get Collin
Have him bring. His. Xbox
We can get djs halo he lives. Right by my mom
Tyson Amundsen
Only merit would
Edward Ekstrom
The only question I have is how will we get him on the network?
Brayden Haws
Okay I think he only has two controllers but I'll tell him
Edward Ekstrom
Does his have wifi?
I'll borrow djs controllers too
Brayden Haws
On the xbox?
Edward Ekstrom
Ya
Brayden Haws
Yeah I think so
Don't they all?
Edward Ekstrom

Colby Condie

John Sherwood

No fire
Brayden Haws
It's for west Korea Colby, they're not our people
Merit Egan
But haws, on the contrary, if you're not going, do I have to?
Brayden Haws

As I told kasey, it's boys vs girls night
And boys rule so we don't have to go
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
But Tyson won't be ther til like 11, you can't rely upon him at this time
Tyson Amundsen
No warthogs in halo 3

Merit Egan
My free agency has been taken away. I have no choice.
Brayden Haws
Can't the girls just do that and we just play?
Tyson Amundsen
I hated how good new Zach friends were
Merit take your balls outta your wife's purse, man
Merit Egan
Has anyone contacted Josh demple?
Kelli says to take your balls out of your motocross thing's purse, tyson.
Brayden Haws
Everyone is fighting
Great halo is ruined
Merit Egan
# boom #roasted
Tyson Amundsen
Fighting IS halo Haws
Hey merit, i know you are but what am I?
Brayden Haws
Friend against friend, brother against brother. This vox is becoming the civil war
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
You think I'm wrong Tyson?
Tyson Amundsen
They call this bulletin material
Brayden Haws

Merit I know you are but what am I?
Merit Egan
A d bag
zach fackrell

Currently
Colby Condie
Jk. I just wanted to say something asinine to take the tension away
#meritVSteezr
Tyson Amundsen
I'm on the Fackrell wall of fame. Being inducted was an honor
zach fackrell
It was a very nice ceremony
haws and merit are also on the wall if I remember correctly.
Eddy never gave us a picture.....
Brayden Haws
Oh I'm on there
Merit Egan
It seems as though tyson and I are equal is all respects except that I'll be haloing before him
Equal in
Brayden Haws
Tyson leave the thing early and beat merit there. Punish him for
Going to the fire
Merit Egan
Ok guys. I have repented and will be ready to halo by 7.
Brayden Haws
God bless you merit
Edward Ekstrom
God bless everyone!
I'll be ready. You know I well
Will*
Merit Egan
So who do we have at 7? Or should I unrepent?
I do have to leave at 10
Brayden Haws
What? Merit these are insane restrictions
Edward Ekstrom
Why?
Brayden Haws
If you come later can you stay later?
Edward Ekstrom
If you have to choose, go to the thing first and play after
Merit Egan
Earlier works better.
Tyson Amundsen
never thought I'd see the day
Merit Egan
I can perhaps come back at 12.
Tyson Amundsen
Holy
Edward Ekstrom
Where do you have to go at 10?
Tyson Amundsen
Where the H is jared too
Brayden Haws
Tyson I meant to bring that up earlier, Jared hasn't been here for days
Tyson Amundsen
Before you go to Eddys stop at his house #churchvisit #lessactive
Time for an intervention
Brayden Haws
He probably met a Latina and moved in
Edward Ekstrom
We still have no solid plans.
Merit, where is your little J going at 10.?
Brayden Haws
Colby what's your itinerary? Bring those pants when we play or I'll come try em before the matches
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
I just saw a thing that 9 years ago Rory's dad placed like 400 dollars on a 500 to 1 odd bet that Rory would win the Open before he was 26. He's 25 right now and if he wins today his dad will make 340,000 dollars
Colby Condie
That's way sweet
Edward Ekstrom
His dad got a lot of money
Colby Condie
So did Rory
Sunday, July 20, 2014 3:04 PM

Merit Egan
I fear that edward has traveled back to provo

Brayden Haws
Merit I almost allowed you the other day but then I forgot
Merit Egan
Do it haws, do it
Brayden Haws
Next time I'm on my computer I will
Might
Maybe
Merit Egan
Haws, maybe you don't know this, but these little things we carry around can do a lot of the same things as a computer.
Brayden Haws
I Know, but I don't wanna do it right now, so I'm setting up a stipulation of when I will
Merit Egan
I'm hurt haws.
Brayden Haws
This isn't about you merit
It's about them
The government
Merit Egan
They already know where you are. That Snowden guy who worked for the government and leaked all that stuff said that the government can take control of any phone on any network at any time. They can use it as a microphone or a camera at any moment.
Brayden Haws
This is to much pressure for me
I can't handle the spotlight
Brayden Haws
Merit keep checking for Eddys location, we have to find him
Merit Egan

Colby Condie
Merit are you in West Jordan? Don't panic I'll come save you
Merit Egan

Check out @mayaj's Tweet: https://twitter.com/mayaj/status/491176828594171905
So we are all at least aware that the Pro Russians in Ukraine shot down the civilian plane to Malaysia and killed 300?
I know Haws is
The bodies have just been lying in fields. Disgusting, outrageous
Merit Egan
That is ridiculous. Weird things are happening in the world today.
You don't hear a worse story than that crazy guy from Utah that went and killed the family in Texas.
Tyson Amundsen
My grandpa used to say "the solution to all our problems is the second coming and the milennium." He wasn't wrong
Its just he said it about once every hour
Merit Egan
very good.
Colby Condie
Obama is getting a ton of heat from this whole debacle. He's handling it horribly in my opinion
Alex Platis
And what's the proper way to handle it? This is in a part of a country that isn't controlled by the government of that country. It's controlled by rebel militants who have unclear ties to the Russian government. I'm not sure what any foreign leader is to do here.
Colby Condie
You can always count on a political issue for Al to chime in
Tyson Amundsen
Not always, but its a good bet
Edward Ekstrom
He should go over there and fight like an army of one.
Tyson Amundsen
And I'll tell you what should have happened Al, a harder stance from the US and Europe from the moment that Russia invaded Ukraine. I don't know that Putin directly ordered this (I wouldn't rule it out) but this stems from him and other groups knowing the international community, including US foreign policy, is too timid
Edward Ekstrom
" Yeah. They call it an army of one in the ads, but they don't mean it. Unless they mean the whole army working together as one. But they certainly don't want one man out there kicking ass like an army of one, which is the way I took it.
"
Tyson Amundsen
Haha is that drillbit?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup.
I wanted to read about the family in texas and this was what came up when I typed "family in texas"
it autofinished to "family in texas caught chupacabra"
http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-family-caught-chupacabra-article-1.1742980
Tyson Amundsen
The dutch really should do something. most of the dead are dutch, according to the article.
And I'm gonna read that eddy
Merit Egan
haha good find eddy
Colby Condie
The video is hilarious
Merit Egan
The real story is that this husband in Utah was abusive to his wife. She filed for divorce and got a restraining order. Her sister flew in from Texas and got her to come home with her. They had her stay with their mom in Texas.

Fast forward, crazy guy goes down to Texas, goes to the sisters house. Ex wife is not staying there. Parents are gone, 15ish year old sister is watching her 4 younger kids. Guy ties them all up and waits for the parents to get home. Parents get home and he ties them up. Then shoots every one of them in the head one by one.

Then he is headed to the grandma's house to kill his ex wife. Somehow, the 15 year old survived. The bullet ricocheted of her skull and didn't kill her. She got up and called the police and told them to go to her grandma's house. They were able to catch him before he did anything else.

So this guy killed 5 people out of a family of 6.
Edward Ekstrom
He abused his mom in san diego the week before because she wouldn't tell him where his ex-wife was either.
he tied her up and assaulted her.
Colby Condie
He chose the wrong state to murder someone. Texas uses the death penalty.
Merit Egan
I'm under the opinion that people like that deserve worse than life in prison or the death penalty. Freaking tattoo "I hate Muslims" on his chest, ship him off to Afghanistan and drop him out of a plane with no shirt on.
Edward Ekstrom
seriously.
Colby Condie
He would get tortured in the worst ways
Serves him right
Tyson Amundsen
Unbelievable
That right there is the influence of Satan
Merit Egan
the fact that he had 5 kids under 15 tied up with their face to the ground and shot them in the head is unbelievable.
Brayden Haws
Guys, just waking up to some stirring debates and comments
I think as far as Ukraine Tyson is right, more should have been done prior, basically we've just been putting up paper embargoes on Russia, they haven't meant anything, we've still been interfacing with them for various, if we really wanted to show our disdain we would just cut of contact until they withdrew. And it's not just the US, the whole UN needs to do more
As for Obama, I just think he could have handled his comments on it more gracefully, spent like 45 seconds commenting on it before diving into a planned speech. And he said his top priority was finding out if Americans were victims, I think that's really where he misspoke and offended. When 9/11 happened other countries leaders were quickly showing their support for us and vowing to assist us, they weren't saying they were worried that people from their own country were involved before they acted
Brayden Haws

Erstwhile I gave Collin my old leather jacket, and he got me these as a repayment
Edward Ekstrom
haha
Brayden Haws
Idk if you guys remember but I met cheech on my mission at the airport
Tyson Amundsen
Another real issue is Al refusing to participate in the Google vox unless he is offended by a political statement. Al, we're your friends. You can't pick and choose when you want to be our friends
Merit Egan
Yeah, I can dis Obama every 10 minutes if you need a reason to google vox

(Shhh don't tell him i did this zeez)
John Sherwood

Tyson Amundsen
John I will if you will
And if we do Brayden will

John Sherwood

Colby Condie

John Sherwood
K I'm doing it

Favorite
Brayden Haws
Hahaha holy gay
Tyson Amundsen
I'm have done likewise. Will you join us Bryan?
Bryan Samuelson
Nope
Brayden Haws
I liked that that the other guy was calling him out
#stopshoemantweets
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Haha of course you won't Bryan. Why do I ask questions to which I already know the answer?
Jared Carter
Don't worry Tyson I'm gonna set up a Twitter account just so I can favorite it. And then retweet it all day long.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha Bryan listen to Jared
Merit Egan
Why do Samye Jensen's hands look like my grandma's?
Tyson Amundsen
Haha merit that's hilarious. Is she engaged to Brandon Prince? Again?
Screw Russia. Just shot down 2 Ukrainian military jets
Not good
Bryan Samuelson
Oh dear
Merit Egan
Stupid Russia.
Brayden Haws
Someone needs to stop Russia
#captainamerica
Erstwhile her hands look jacked
Bryan Samuelson
Rocky IV was the only thing that stopped the Cold War but now sly is all washed up and we have nowhere to turn
Merit Egan
Teezer, your question makes me have a question. Since I don't know much about Sam these days, did their first engagement fall through?
Brayden Haws
we gotta call in the expendables Bryan
Tyson Amundsen
Yes it did merit. Clearly taking a toll on her hand game. He used to buy all her lotion so when it fell thru she suffered
Clearly
Merit Egan
Haha
Brayden Haws
In that situation do you use the same ring?
Or have to get a new one
Jared Carter
I'd say the second time you wait on the ring. Don't want one of those awkward can I get the ring back talks again.
I've had a few myself and boy are they awkward.
Colby Condie
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha, great convo this morning
*last night
Brayden Haws
Guys I would like to propose for tonight: a. Basketball or b. Bowling
Bryan Samuelson
I feel good about both of those options
Edward Ekstrom
I'm out tonight. Packing for the big move.
John Sherwood
I'm out til Saturday night. Huge test Saturday morn.
Merit Egan
I may be out tonight. Early indications point towards my wife having the flu today.
Tyson Amundsen
I'm out tonight
Merit Egan
And your reasoning...Everyone has been giving a reason
Bryan Samuelson
#shadyteezer
John Sherwood
What is going on Saturday night? I want to celebrate
Brayden Haws
Concierge
Merit Egan
I'd be out until late evening on saturday night. ETA 9ish. #iwillbeinprovo
Are they showing Last of the Mohicans sometime this weekend?
Tyson Amundsen
Would anyone have interest in getting tickets to RSL tomo?
Merit Egan
I would, but I won't. #familyparty #pigroast
Brayden Haws
I would, but I won't. #work
John Sherwood
I would but I musnt. #test
Brayden Haws
Also can I say it's madness that jr salt is gonna be a starter for the U this season
Edward Ekstrom
What?
Merit Egan
Eddy didn't understand cause he's a BYU fan now. That's what living in Provo will do to you. #welcomehomeeddy
Edward Ekstrom
No way!
BYU stone like pooh
#brookwoodJingles
Stinks
Alex Crawford
Junior salt was like 2 years older than us. How is he still in college?
Brayden Haws
Went on a mission, went to a junior college, red shirted and then played last year and this
Alex Crawford
Man I remember lifting in the basement at Brighton and junior salts size instilled fear into every fiber of my muscle-less frame.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
So is he a senior?
Brayden Haws
Yeah he should be?
Tyson Amundsen
This info doesn't surprise me
Jared Carter
Dudes party time!
Brayden Haws
Jared where do you go all
The time? You're never on here
Tyson Amundsen
We demand answers
Also Bryan come to my house right now
Brayden Haws
Tyson what are you and Bryan doing? Invite me
Tyson Amundsen
We're gonna go get married. Not to each other.
To some tennis playing babes
Bryan get on the vox
This moment
Jared Carter
Teazer where are you?
Tyson Amundsen
Jared we are half an hour late
What do you have to say for yourself
Also, does anyone want to hang out tomo night?
Jeff Knudsen
Has anyone heard about the event Todd is recruiting for Saturday and if so are any of you going?
Colby Condie
What is this event?
Is it a business scam? If so, me and Jared don't want any part of it. Me and Jared both lost $400
Alex Platis
Haha. Probably a pyramid scheme
http://youtu.be/a231RLKyfPw
Tyson Amundsen
No Jeff
Brayden Haws
Heard about it, not attending
Merit Egan
I was recruited, making me think it is just a business thing, I am not attending.
Brayden Haws
From what I saw on Facebook Todd's bro in laws started a new home security company so I assume it's for that
Colby Condie
Is it Tym Security?
That's the same company that me and Jared briefly worked for a couple years ago. Worst choice in my adult life
Brayden Haws
It could be, cortnee made some post about this awesome new company a few days ago
Merit Egan
It's a scam for sure. Count me out.
Brayden Haws
But merit if we all
Give him all our money he might could maybe invest it and we may become perhaps rich
Merit Egan
I'm in. My bank account number is 140639867. Give it to Todd.
Alex Platis
Todd is The Wolf of Newcastle Drive
Thursday, July 24, 2014 11:13 AM
Tyson Amundsen
Since when did Raymond Felton play for the Mavs?!
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha yes
Merit Egan
Since he got arrested in NY on gun charges
Edward Ekstrom
Have any of you watched the internet's own boy?
Colby Condie
nope
Edward Ekstrom
I want to see it.
Thursday, July 24, 2014 5:33 PM
John Sherwood
Ju I may dinner soon. Aaron's 7 730. Would n e 1 care to accompany us?
Ha dont vox and drive. I tried to say wr are eating dinner around 7 730..
Colby Condie
Where are you eating john?
John Sherwood
I don't know yet. Do you have any preferences?
Thursday, July 24, 2014 10:00 PM
Brayden Haws
Goalmes
Merit Egan
Tyson, what Internet site will allow me to see highlights of the rsl game the best?
John Sherwood
Realsaltlake.com
Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen
It won't play on my dumb smartphone
But you better believe I've listened to that within the last year
Brayden Haws
Pokemon!!!!
Tyson Amundsen
Oh haha that's that part? Glory
Brayden Haws
also it was so hard to find that, I couldn't find like any of his songs on YouTube so I had to go on German Wikipedia and then link to YouTube
All worth it
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha yes! ! ! ! ! ! !
Great find Haws, great! Find!
Good FOR you.
Merit Egan
Hello everybody. What is the hip hap hippity hap tonight?
Bryan Samuelson
I think I'm going over to Hambone's, but Maybe I could bring him to party with us
Brayden Haws
I'm ready to party
I'd like to see if there's anywhere showing last of the Mohicans tonight
Merit Egan
haha, chances are good
But i only play if Tyson plays now
Brayden Haws
Merit that's never a good stipulation
It rarely comes true
Though I want the same
John Sherwood
I want to hang out but can only hangout til 10.
Brayden Haws
John the tester, god bless
Alex Platis
Halo
http://youtu.be/Iw2oqtZoc8s
Tyson Amundsen
I always play, its just not always here.
Merit Egan
Are you FifaCheating on me?
Tyson Amundsen
And my sister got in today to go to wicked tomo with my mom and sister in law, so tonight I'm out til late
And tomo is the Wallflowers concert with me and Haws. Free at esa 8 pm
Merit, never FIFAcheating. Not that
Brayden Haws
The concert will be the event of a lifetime, I hope all come
John Sherwood
I'd love to play fifa as soon as possible though. I could play as early as 2.
Merit Egan
#corporatelife gettin off at 2 on a Friday. Lucky

Tyson Amundsen
Check out @StatHunting's Tweet: https://twitter.com/StatHunting/status/492749175361380352
Who can tell us what Steven Smith has done? My soccer ppl are tweeting about how he's an idiot
ESPN guy
Brayden Haws
Oh he made some comments today about ray rices domestic violence case but he worded it way stupidly making it sound like he was blaming abuse on the women that get abused
Tyson Amundsen
Women always gravitate towards the douchebags and gays
All they need is some old fashioned teezin'
How oft would I have gathered them, but they would not
Colby Condie
As a hen gathereth her kin
Merit Egan
People I don't like who are prominent sports analysts:
1. Steven A. Smith
2. Dan Lebatard
3. Brian Windhorst
Tyson Amundsen
Let's keep this list going
Brayden Haws
In this case Colby, Tyson should avoid his kin
John Anderson, who is on both espn and wipeout
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Brayden Haws
Jonathan Coachmen
Merit Egan
People I do like:
1: Bill Simmons
2: Charles Barkley
3: Most other ESPN analysts
4: Woody Paige
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan, let's talk your shiz list of ppl
Brayden Haws
Frank Isola, he's the jam
Tyson Amundsen
I like bill simmons. Rick Reilly
Merit Egan
I like most of the local people:
Colby Condie
Chris Berman
Bryan Samuelson
What's that guy on cold pizza or whatever, he's the worst
Tyson Amundsen
Dick Vitale
Colby Condie
Mike Smith
Bryan Samuelson
The one who had drama with Richard Sherman
Merit Egan
DJ, tony parks, hans, gordon and checketts
Colby Condie
The black guy Bryan?
Tyson Amundsen
Bayless, Skip
Colby Condie
I don't like Skip
Bryan Samuelson
No, cold pizza is not the right show. Yeah skip Bayless
Tyson Amundsen
I will defend him for liking Tim Tebow, but that's it
Merit Egan
Anyone remember Max Kellerman? He was the original host of Around the Horn. He was/is cool. Makes appearances on different shows now and then. I like him.
Bryan Samuelson
I do remember max kellerman. I feel like he also had something to do with boxing
Merit Egan
Yeah he left to do boxing but is now coming out of it. He is on SportsNation quite a bit. Probably just wanted to work with that good looking female co-host
Bryan Samuelson
Haha the good looking female co-host, no one is complaining about that
Brayden Haws
I like gordon monson as well
Colby Condie
I like Kevin Blackistone a lot. He's on around the horn
I also enjoy PTI. Mike Wilbon and Tony Kornheiser
Tyson Amundsen
As far as soccer goes, Dunseth and Bill Riley are excellent
Twellman is good usually
I'm slightly down on Alexi Lalas but not much
Brayden Haws
I feel like twellman usually has some funny things to say. Which I enjoy
Tyson Amundsen
Bob ley is great
Brayden Haws
If Lalas had his long hair he'd be cooler
Tyson Amundsen
JP Dellacamera isn't my favorite
Alejandro Moreno has grown on me
Merit Egan
Not a huge fan of Wilbon. I like Kornheiser
National Radio, it's hard to beat Colin Cowherd
Tyson Amundsen
Brent Musberger occasionally did soccer. Poorly, in my opinion
Merit Egan
not a big fan of Dan Patrick
Musberger is a perv
Tyson Amundsen
What are feelings of Jim Rome?
Brayden Haws
The greatest football announcer is/was dan dierdorf
May he rest in peace
Merit Egan
Jim Rome had his time in the spotlight
Bryan Samuelson
I don't like him Rome
Obnoxious
Merit Egan
He sucks now.
Colby Condie
I think Jim Rome is funny
Brayden Haws
I feel like rome doesn't really talk about sports that much
Tyson Amundsen
I'm gonna throw this out there- I like madden
Brayden Haws
Mostly just discussed people he hates and how cool he is
Colby Condie
He called out David Stern big time like last year I think
Tyson Amundsen
I feel like you have to like Madden
Joe Buck is good
Bryan Samuelson
I love Madden. Reminds me of Hot rod hundley
Colby Condie
Buck is good.
Madden just doesn't give any real insight to a football game. He just talks
Bryan Samuelson
Gus Johnson calling an NCAA tournament game is what God envisioned when he created basketball
Merit Egan
Patrick Kinahan is the worst.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Colby Condie
THE SLIPPER STILL FITS!!
Tyson Amundsen
Brad Rock is a great writer. Do great writers make good commentators or analysts?
Merit Egan
They would make good radio hosts I think
Like Gordon Monsen
But that's unconfirmed
Colby Condie
Most commentators I feel like have a writing background
Brayden Haws
Gordon is a great example
Tyson Amundsen
Wright Thompson. He does great journalism for ESPN soccer but idk
Brayden Haws
But idk if there are others
Colby Condie
Analysts especially
Merit Egan
Someone mentioned Chris Berman. Isn't he just the worst
Tyson Amundsen
Bolerjack?
Merit Egan
Bolerjack is way good.
Surprisingly, he actually knows a ton
Tyson Amundsen
Hatpring?
Bryan Samuelson
I like Bolerjack. Don't love harpring. Still miss Ron Boone
Brayden Haws
Berman is horrible for football, but when he calls the home run derby there is nothing more horrible on gods green earth
Merit Egan
He (Bolerjack) sometimes seems a little awkward like he's just a good news guy, but if you hear him on the radio, he's great and very insightful
Tyson Amundsen
"We haven't seen that yet, in Denver yet!"
Colby Condie
Oh my gosh Berman SUCKS at baseball commentating
My ears bleed
Merit Egan
I like harpring for some of his breakdown. Not great delivery or anything else.
Except hair, great hair
Tyson Amundsen
Is Al Davis the Monday night football guy?
Bryan Samuelson
His nickname attempts are the worst
Merit Egan
haha
Brayden Haws
Al Davis owed te raiders
Now dead
Al michaels
Bryan Samuelson
I feel like harpring really likes it when someone does a hard foul, that makes
Me laugh
Al michaels is good
Tyson Amundsen
That's right. I'm good with Al Michaels
Brayden Haws
Which reminds me Chris Collinsworth
Is awesome
Bryan Samuelson
Mike Breen for the nba is top baller
Merit Egan
Not a big fan of Reggie Miller doing NBA games
I really like Van Gundy
Bryan Samuelson
Agreed. I liked Reggie as a player, but not as a commentator
Merit Egan
Not a fan of that old guy, who coached memphis... what's his name?
Brayden Haws
I like Hubie brown just cause he's so old and doesn't have to put up with anyone's shi
Merit Egan
haha, contradiciton
Brayden Haws
Which agreed merit he's not that good
Merit Egan
Hubie brown
Brayden Haws
I just like that quality about him
Merit Egan
haha yes
Bryan Samuelson
Haha yes, I agree Haws
Merit Egan
I don't like that he just over emphasizes anyone playing well that night. CJ Miles could be having a good game, scoring like 20 points, and you'd think CJ was a 10 time all-star the way Hubie talks about him during the game
Too high on the highs, too low on the lows
Colby Condie
Van Gundy is hands down the best in the NBA in my opinion
Brayden Haws
I also really like Doug Collins
Colby Condie
He says things that others won't and gives way good analysis and breaks down plays
Brayden Haws
Abrasive as a coach but knows everything
Merit Egan
i agree. Van Gundy for President
Bryan Samuelson
Van gundy is good. How do we feel about David Locke? I think he's a good guy and has good insight. But I can't stand listening to him on the radio. Doesn't focus on the actual play by play enough
He does say funny things though. Like when he quotes Ludacris at Kevin Garnett
Brayden Haws
Yeah I think Locke has funny things to say. But I don't like him on the game call and also I feel like he just tries to bend his advanced stats to suit his argument, be that true or not
Merit Egan
Locke puts just a little too much emphasis on analytics. I listen to his podcast from time to time and it is just too much
He's just got too much energy
like, take a nap or something
Brayden Haws
He must sleep like 3 hours a night, he always tweets from the end of a jazz game til like 3 in the morning and then does his tip-off at like 630
Merit Egan
seriously
Brayden Haws
He just has an IV of red bull all the time
And snorts 5 hour ebergy
Merit Egan
haha
and Bsam, do you actually like Ron Boone?
Cause there is nothing more boring than Ron Boone. Except the rare pairing of Ron Boone and Steve Brown
Bryan Samuelson
More for the comedic effect Mert. And nostalgia. I loved him and hot Rod because the only thing Booner would ever say was the Rainbow and Peppermill casino bit
The rest was pure hot rod talking, it was awesome
Brayden Haws
So grossest thing, at fieldhouse they have towels hanging with spray to wipe down the machines . This guy just took one and wiped off all his sweat with it and the put it back and grabbed another one and wrapped it around his neck and walked off with it. Those things have prob never been washed
Edward Ekstrom
Grossz
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Brayden Haws
Insta staph infection.
Merit Egan
Zach, are you back from Cali/
I wish I could just see you locale
zach fackrell

Driving through Tyson's mission area. Found this gem
(I'm still in Cali, till Sunday)
Tyson Amundsen
I love you Zach. And LA and pokemon cars
Brayden Haws
I bet Zach is gone til Sunday
Speak of the devil
Tyson Amundsen
And merit either his locale or shoeman would do, but shoeman isn't revealing Sachs whereabouts
He actually had a good tweet recently. I tried to compliment it
zach fackrell
Sup guys. I miss you all and love you dearly. I hope we party soon.

#livetweet #truth
Haha I'll have to check it out
Brayden Haws
I like to party and I hope everyone else out there does
Merit Egan
yeah what are we doing!
That is a questlamation point
Tyson Amundsen
Merit we're going to the concert tomo!
Outside ESA!
Music!
Brayden Haws
Tonight I'd do anything!
Anything!
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
I may be available late. 11. After sister goes to bed
John Sherwood
I need you some settling to get my mind off testin
Tyson Amundsen
But just cuz I said that doesn't mean Haws and Meerut can't play until I get there, instead of moping around til their wives get mad #subtweet
*ducks head
Brayden Haws
We weren't moping Tyson
Can't believe you'd even accuse us
7-730 kick?
Merit Egan
I hate Tysoin
He is so mean
Brayden Haws
Tyson we hate you
#subtweet
Merit Egan
Let's sell him from our Fifa Team

Brayden Haws
I bet we could get Freddy Adu for him #burn
John Sherwood
730 kick start
Tyson Amundsen
I'm a glutton for the truth, even tho truth hurts #popcornsubtweetbryan
RSL reserves are tied 1-1 seven minutes in. Free stream on the website

Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Oh id come to sandy, they got the good snow cones
John Sherwood

Brayden Haws
Feef? Snow cone? Clubs and swords?
John Sherwood
We are gong to the sno cone shack at 830. Everyone should come partake. Then we party hearty
Brayden Haws
The reams one?
John Sherwood
Aye
Merit Egan
I'm in
Brayden Haws
We're in
Bryan bring your women
We're about to depart
John Sherwood
We are here
Brayden Haws
Bad feef
We really needed Tyson there controlling the team
Tyson Amundsen
Are you calling it quits? Why so early?
Why so serious?
Brayden Haws
We lost like 5 straight
Couldn't buy a goal
Jerry's gonna get fired
Tyson Amundsen
Son of a B
Who played? I'm ready
No way we lose like that at Merits house. Must if been bryans
Brayden Haws
Merit John jeffe Colby, we even got minni in for a game
Tyson Amundsen
What a crew! You guys shoulda won. It's like last year we lost the open cup final to DC United. They were clearly worse than us, but we got hosed.
Brayden Haws
The refs were screwing us
But there were also lots of blunders on our part
I cost us a game cause I was selfish rather than passing to talmage for the classic goal
But he wasn't gonna make it so I had to shoot
Merit Egan
We won our first 2 then fell apart
Saturday, July 26, 2014 9:13 AM
Colby Condie
Good luck to John as he his currently taking a massive test #xcerptpower
Also it's possible Russia could lose it's World Cup hosting priveleges in 2018.

Nah man. That is Feefa saying they won't.strip it from them
Brayden Haws
God bless John

""If Putin doesn’t actively cooperate on clearing up the plane crash, the soccer World Cup in Russia in 2018 is unimaginable," Peter Beuth, the interior minister of the German state of Hesse, told Bild."
Third to last paragraph.
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah but that's just like the mayor of Hesse. FIFA says before that they like holding it in those places cuz it puts spotlights on problems. Idiots
Edward Ekstrom
I stand by my army of one quote. Send Obama over there as an army of one

Also someone needs to teach me to screen shot then I won't have to use links
Brayden Haws
I feel like after Dubai it's obvious FIFA just wants money. And what a dumb comment on highlighting the issues
Tyson Amundsen
Is Dubai in Qatar? Serious question.
If so, GTK man. GTK
If not, then why are you talking about Dubai
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, I'm bringing my wife and kids to my company pay tonight. #thugLife
Party*
Brayden Haws
Haha no idk what my problem is
I'm so stupid man
Edward Ekstrom
#notThug
Brayden Haws
Tyson how has summer made me so stupid? You can write a research project on that for med school
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
I spelled of "uv" one year after summer.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha except I'll falsify my research to prove summer makes us smarter, faster, and better. And I'll lobby for more summer
Edward Ekstrom
It's one of the major problems in society today
Colby Condie
Most companies offer paid time off for vacation and sick days. Schools should do the same. Free A's on assignments even if we miss. Make it happen Tyson. Convince America. You ran for president in high school
Brayden Haws
Schumann is the gayest
Colby Condie
John?! Is that you?
John Sherwood
I'm halfway through. It's tough

Brayden Haws
Gutty performance John
That's what we like
John Sherwood
That's what I like
Tyson Amundsen
You're a crafty financial analyst
Brayden Haws
Only took you like half the allotted time? They should give you a medal for that
Tyson Amundsen
So now you are all done, certified, verified, bonafide?
John Sherwood
Nope. Another test next week
John Sherwood
So jacque Schmidt goodman invited all of is to her parents pool tonight. I rsvpd all of us
Brayden Haws

John Sherwood
Whenever I think.
When is the concerto?
Brayden Haws

John Sherwood
Who's playing?
Brayden Haws
The wallflowers and train
Free at ESA
Tyson Amundsen
Want to do the concert, not committed yet unfortunately. Not sure I want to go to Jacques, not committed.
Brayden Haws
Tyson I used to live life like you, never commit to anything, and then you chastised me
Tyson Amundsen
False. Your lack of commitment was far more broad than mine.
I'm going to lengths to have transparency as well #nosecretgardens

What did everyone do tonight? Rollcall?
Colby Condie
Went to dinner with the Minnicks then chilled at my house
Merit Egan
Went to provo for an extended cousin lame obligation thing. Got home a little before 10, did nothing.
Brayden Haws
The highlight of the night was seeing Teezr at the concert, the second highlight was that elder holland was there for the wallflowers
Tyson Amundsen
I second Haws comments. Then I wanna talk about shoeman. I'm really glad he calmed my fears about adventures
I mean, i bet all of us woke up this morning and thought "I'd go on an adventure but its pretty dangerous. Better not"
Brayden Haws
Personally I've been terrified of adventuring my whole life but shoemans tweet has changed my life and I'm not afraid anymore
#testimonial
Tyson Amundsen
Thanks for sharing your feelings Haws. This is a safe place
Also, Colby gets married like in 7 days. If we wanna do a pre marriage bachelor party, we gotta do it now
And colby wanted camping. No way we get all of us to do that, but I'd give it a shot. People are gonna have to get some work off
Hello Eddy. Good morning! And if I don't see ya good afternoon and good night
It's either that or we do a post marriage bachelor party. Or the ore marriage bachelor party is not camping
Sunday, July 27, 2014 9:06 AM
Edward Ekstrom
I'm in for whatever!
Plan it, and I will come.
John Sherwood
I can't camp. But I can party.
Brayden Haws
I still vote that we camp the 15-16 as a friendship conglomerate, anyone is invited and I can plan that. As for the bachelor party, lets just have a rager tomorrow of Colby's choosing
Brayden Haws
So today we sat by our bishop that just got released, he Was insane, looked like he was going to clown college. Had on a white and pale purple seetsucker suit, with purple and blue striped socks, a blue shirt, a blue and yellow tie and grey oxford and was eating a box of chocolates
Tyson Amundsen
What the..?
Brayden Haws
Idk man it was nuts
Tyson Amundsen
Also what is seetsucker. Pic please
Colby Condie
Seersucker. It's a striped pattern of white and another color. Usually on blazers or suits
Funky pattern
Brayden Haws

Like that fabric patch but his was purple

And his suit was like linen so it fit all baggy, he just really let himself go in the last two weeks
Edward Ekstrom
What the?
Merit Egan
Live Google vox. Jared stepping up to the pulpit now!
Edward Ekstrom
Ayoooooooo
Sunday, July 27, 2014 5:35 PM
Tyson Amundsen
Is jared the new bishop?
Colby Condie
Jared probably got called as the bishop in the Spanish ward
zach fackrell
felicidades
Tyson Amundsen
Welcome home Zach?

Tyson Amundsen
Yayayayayaya
Brayden Haws

Jared Carter

Brayden Haws
Jared you can't just get on here once a week and make demands of us
Tyson Amundsen
Couldn't agree more Haws.
He's the new Shane Liu
Jared Carter
Take that back Tyson I will never try to involve you in my pyramid investment scheme!
Also haws you know how much I hate texting.
Why can't I just see you all face to face
Like at a party
Or a club
Or a concert
Or at merits playing fifa
Why must I be limited by words on a page.
Brayden Haws
I would like all those things, but we gotta plan em and you gotta come for it to happen
Tyson Amundsen
It can't happen til we plan it. How do we plan it with everyone at once? The Google Vox
Colby Condie
Gossip question for the vox: is Jade Deollos dating someone else now? I thought she had a way serious boyfriend missionary she was waiting for. Tyson?
Tyson Amundsen
First and foremost, Hicks is engaged is he is out. And the dude she was way serious with did go on mission. That's the end of the facts I know. I assume she is waiting for him, even if she dates ppl
Edward Ekstrom
Remember when we used to not be able to plan anything I here?
Now we just plan up a shizload of awesome stuff on here.
Brayden Haws
We plan everything here. Merit would just get so mad and refuse to participate but now it's our life
zach fackrell
whats the next thing we're planning?
quick trip to bear lake anyone
?
bare lake
beer lake
Brayden Haws
A lake of beer? That's Colby's Bach party
zach fackrell
beer flowing like wine
Tyson Amundsen
We need a boat. Cabin preferable, could camp
zach fackrell

Furthermore, I'm likely free tomo. Possibly going on a solid hike. Neff's canyon Haws?

Gutentag
Edward Ekstrom
I move Thursday. If anyone could help me lift some furniture I would be much obliged.
Bryan Samuelson
What time Ed?
Edward Ekstrom
Around 5
I really only need one person
Annie is pregnant so she can't lift with me
Bryan Samuelson
I can. As long as you promise to have me ready for chronic at 8 #playoffpush
Brayden Haws
Eddy I have work or I would donate my muscles to your cause
John Sherwood
What is the time of temple in sat colb? (Or anyone)
Merit Egan
I second that question. I'm sure it's on the invite, but boys don't look at those things
John Sherwood
True dat double true
Brayden Haws
I don't know. It's across the room from me currently, but that's a lot of work to go look
Merit Egan
Don't even think about it Haws. If you got up every time you needed to do something...Your knees would by done for by the time you were 40
#nevergetup #neversurrendersitting
Brayden Haws
And I already had knee surgery so I def can't risk it
Merit Egan
haha yeah I forgot about that
you definitely cannot risk it
Bryan Samuelson
It's a sit in Haws. Take a stand for sitting
Brayden Haws
I'm living on borrowed time here
Tyson Amundsen
Haha well done all
Brayden Haws
Erstwhile where is Colby himself? Just trying to party with him and all he replys in here is "hello"
It ain't right
Merit Egan
Haws, don't judge. Colby is busy getting ready to change the name of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Colby, what are you going to change the name to, I forgot?
Tyson Amundsen
Hard hitting Google Vox with Brayden Haws
It's the next new rage
Haws where are you? Come to my house today. You never responded about if you were busy with your dad this morning or not. Come over and if we can swim we will and if we can't we'll party
Brayden Haws
Dood I text awhile ago saying I can party at 1
Tyson Amundsen
That's a colby response. Tell me the details
Aka what occurred this morn? That's two hours away
Brayden Haws
Oh I see what you want. So I called my dad at like 9 but he decided he didn't want to go today. But then my boss called me because she is outta town and asked if I can go do a few things at the clinic for her so currently I'm gonna go do that and then I can party
Colby Condie
Hello guys
Merit Egan
Hello guys
John Sherwood
When the temple colb?
Merit Egan
Yes colb, and please specify time zone.
Brayden Haws
MST is preferred
Colby Condie
It's at NOON o'clock CSST (Colby spiritual standard time) which is generally not as late as CST
Merit Egan
haha
New question...it's getting close to fantasy football time. Should we do our first ever 'X'cerpt Fantasy Football League?
Tyson Amundsen
I'll respectfully decline. I won't check it
John Sherwood
I would do it if there is commitment from the lot
Iff
Iff = if and only if
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah I know I can't commit. Drew would likely commit
John Sherwood
The ball kicker?
Brayden Haws
I love football but I usually don't check fantasy
But I would if everyone is doing it
#peerpressure
Colby Condie
Merit I would for sure do it
I was thinking about fantasy football yesterday actually and wanted to enter in one
Tyson Amundsen
Sam is the ball kicker. He'd do it. Drew fuller and Blake love fantasy
Tyson Amundsen

Teezr is the keeper of the truth
Tyson Amundsen
John man you are authorized to put 'em in here. Any day any time
John Sherwood
Level 2 security breached
Shoeman security*
Edward Ekstrom
English question for you guys.
Nights like these are what summer is all about?
or is?
He put is, I would probably put are.
Merit Egan
how you wrote it would be correct I believe. Plural nights receives are, singular summer receives is.
He could have said, "A night like this is what summer is all about"
Edward Ekstrom
Yes
Merit Egan
Or, "A night like this is what summers are all about"
Edward Ekstrom
but it should have been nights like these are what summer is all about
Merit Egan
Or, "I'm gay"
Colby Condie
Or "these nights are what summer enjoys being all about"
Tyson Amundsen
bravo guys
Edward Ekstrom
Beautiful day again. I hate work on days like this
Tyson Amundsen

John Sherwood
Struggle cities slums!
#passivelybutthurt
Colby Condie
I lived in Italy. There ain't no struggle city there. Bullshi
John Sherwood
I wasn't referring to italy as struggle city. Just shoemans city of struggle
Merit Egan
Tyson, you have brought a great thing to this chat with those tweets. #keepitgoing
Brayden Haws

Tyson did you do this?
Colby Condie
Yes John I understood your humor. I was poking fun at the tweet
Hahahaha that's a perfect description of Tyson
John Sherwood
Ok good. And tzr, you've done it again you rascal

Brayden Haws
No way she's Mormon
Maybe she is
But she used to bang all
The time would talk about it in greshes class
Tyson Amundsen

Jared Carter

not only do you refuse to vox with any regularity, you will also hide all your pot stickers
Jared Carter
Dude who is the Molly seh addict you guys are talking about.
Dude I don't know what her last name is. It didn't come up. Its like b something
Bogart
Boogert
Boocra
Brayden Haws
Molly Booger?
That's a fake name
She gave you a fake name to cover up her seh having
Tyson Amundsen
You've been duped man
She probably supports ordain women
Jared Carter
It's Molly boogert that's her real honest to goodness name.
Tyson Amundsen
Sounds hot. I'd pick her for sure.
Jared Carter
Dude she really is. Come to our singles ward I'll introduce you.

John Sherwood
I want a halo.bach party. That's my only wish
Merit Egan
We must grant that wish.
And as my wedding gift to you john, I will go 1 entire game without driving a vehicle.
but only one
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
John Sherwood
Ha deal. Unless I'm on your team
Then all vehicles all the days
Merit Egan
Agreed. Let's play Halo at 6:30 on Friday night and at noon on saturday afternoon
Colby Condie
i'd be there
Merit Egan
haha
Colby Condie
i have plans right now but i can do some shifting
John Sherwood
Next week halo
Merit Egan
your ability to set your priorities is an inspiration to us all
Edward Ekstrom
My house is going to be Halo central.
We can just leave Xboxen at the ready.
Tyson Amundsen
and we declare next Monday night official John Batchelor party for Halo?
Edward Ekstrom
I've got a meeting Monday night at 6 but I could do after.
Merit Egan
Isn't this a two day bachelor party? Monday and Tuesday night?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Merit Egan
Also, we need to have a colbinski bach party this week. maybe tonight
Colb, tell us your wishes
Colby Condie
i can only do tonight or thursday night after chronic. i would very much love camping but it seems that the rain and last minute planning might make that difficult
Merit Egan
I could do tonight or tomorrow after chronic as well. Unfortunately Chronic is an 8pm game
Edward Ekstrom
Woof.
Colby Condie
i think it might be about the same time for tonight too cause i have a appointment with my stake president at 8:30
Edward Ekstrom
Let's do after chronic
Colby Condie
i know it's not optimal but its the best i can do
Tyson Amundsen
don't worry Colby. We're going on August 15th camping. That's your bachelor party
Colby Condie
good.
Merit Egan
August 16th is the opening morning of the archery hunt. Where are you camping?
Tyson Amundsen
That's why you're here merit. We'll be in a real campsite, so no one will shoot us
Merit Egan
Schwhere will it be?
Colby Condie
Or we can camp somewhere that allows archery. Wake up and shoot a deer
Brayden Haws
We'll camp at like tanner flats
Merit Egan
I've got my bow ready, I'll get us a deer for dinner
Colby Condie
Cook it for breakfast
Brayden Haws
Or just out in the woods, everyone wear all brown
Colby Condie
Haha good merit. You get dinner I'll get breakfast
All brown. Hahaha worst color to wear
John Sherwood
I actually could hangout tonight. Not after chronic though. And let's do another camping trip in a month so I can come too
Merit Egan
Duplicate this guy.
except with a bow which will be dang near impossible
Colby Condie
It would require a crossbow for sure
Edward Ekstrom
Merit what do you do with all the meet?  just sell it?
Merit Egan
No we freeze it and eat it over the course of a few months. My large family devours those beasts quick enough.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha that's a lot o' meat.
Edward Ekstrom
That's a lot of screen real estate.
Merit Egan
haha, how big are those screens?
Tyson Amundsen
Can we confirm Halo Monday for John's bachelor? Location Eddy's mom? Roll call

Edward Ekstrom
Yea it does.
Merit Egan
Seinfeld fans, how/when does George convert Susan back from lesbianism?
Bryan Samuelson
Shoot boys, I'll be out of town on the 6th. I'll skype in
Brayden Haws
He just proposes to her and she says yes
"Her lesbianism didn't take"
Merit Egan
Haha, is it soon after he sees her at the movie store?
Brayden Haws
No it's like two seasons after
Season and a half
She's lesbian for awhile but then Jerry and George make the pact to grow up and get married and so George just goes to her apart and proposes
Merit Egan
I'll have to go back and watch them. It's been a while since I've been committed to Seinfeld. But i do recall the marriage pact.

Brayden Haws

Dude Katie snuck up on the table and I didn't see her coming. As soon as I had a visual on her I made like a bandit. I was not going to be having a conversation with her.
Edward Ekstrom
Teezer, how'd things go with that girl?
Brayden Haws
Dood that guy is a weirdy she could do way better
Tyson Amundsen
Idk Ed. We have interesting history. I thought she was looking nice anoche so I got sucked in. Idk if I'll try anything again

To say I'm "excited" for Halo is an understatement
Brayden Haws
I would say I'm "exceedingly exuberant" about it
John Sherwood
Nice. I'm "extremely e(x)cstatic". I really am.
Hello halo. Still not sure what my name will be
Merit Egan
I want to create a guy this time. I hate having my name made up for me
I'll come over Wednesday at 5:15 for creation
and tonight for practice
Tyson Amundsen
I'll do thaf
Brayden Haws
I will also make my own player

Merit I bet I can name every player in that pic L to R: Ariel Ortega, Javier Zanetti, Gabriel Batistuta, Juan Sebastian Verón, and Diego Simeone
Also its a funny pic
Brayden Haws
I like that he's religious. But I don't like that he thinks he's an nfl quarterback, cause he never will be. He could be such a great player at another position but he's too stubborn to be
I also hate how good people think he is when he's not
Merit Egan
I'll drive you over there zach. Then I can be "I brought ze tongs"
Tyson Amundsen
He's wholesome under enormous pressure. That can't be understated. Also I don't think anyone really thinks he's an NFL qb, that's why he isn't on a team
Brayden Haws
No one in the nfl does, but all his fans do
Like I just feel like he's wasting a ton of talent cause he's too stubborn

John Sherwood

Merit Egan
Favorited
meanwhile, I just unfollowed 55+ people #thepurge #muchneeded #WhyWasIStillFollowingJocelynKing #WTF #TeezMadeMe
Brayden Haws
Merit you're a great example to us all
I'm unfollowing people right now
John Sherwood
I'll follow suit
Tyson Amundsen
I made you unfollow merit. I've discussed how liberating I find it to unfriend and unfollow.
Fun fact: I never followed Jocelyn. Our business was pre mission pre twitter
Merit Egan
haha, I meant you made me follow her. Cause she knew you, so then she turned into a creepy stalker girl and followed all your friends. Me, being nice, and not wanting to ruin any potential there, followed her back. Now, years and years later, I have had to unfollow her
Potential meaning you and her potential, if the pot was ever going to heat back up. This was all right at the time of your homecoming.
Brayden Haws
Tyson it's true that you're are the original unfollower, but I associate you more with Facebook purges. So it was nice to get a fresh inspiration to infinite people in merit
Tyson Amundsen
Oh yeah, I'm with ya. She followed you man, I told her how cool my friends were
Haws you are right man
Merit Egan
Yeah man
Tyson Amundsen
I have never had a twitter purge
Edward Ekstrom
Work poop is about to begin.
Tyson Amundsen
Mostly I follow only soccer people so no need to purge old friends
Merit Egan
at your homecoming, she walked up to me and was like, "Merit?" So clearly she stalked all of us because you told her how cool we were.
Tyson Amundsen
Except I think i had to purge lenny a year ago
Brayden Haws
I never followed shoeman but if I did I would have purged him
Tyson Amundsen
Guys I'm stoked for #hellohalo tomo
Should we do another count estimate?

Merit Egan
What time is this "Test"?
Edward Ekstrom
at 1:30
Tyson Amundsen
No Jeff no Bryan no Crawdad
Merit Egan
also, I've just decided quotes make things funny
Tyson Amundsen
Jared 12?
Brayden Haws
Jared should be there
But we have no way of knowing if he will
Tyson Amundsen
No colby. Jared 12
Merit Egan
Is someone bringing an "xbox?"
Tyson Amundsen
Confirmative
Haws your job to get Jared there
Zach 13?
Who else
Merit Egan
JOOOOOSH
Edward Ekstrom
Where is zach.  He said he's bringing a few.
Brayden Haws
Eddy we still need Collins Xbox right?
Edward Ekstrom
Yes haws
Tyson Amundsen
Spenny will bring a wireless one. Idk if that elimates yours
Edward Ekstrom
We have kevin's mine, spenny's and we need haws's
Brayden Haws
I'll bring it but we'll need two extra controllers
I can also bring Collin the person if we need a other player
zach fackrell
Oh I'm in. I can bring Schumann or maybe josh if needs be
Edward Ekstrom
I'll get controllers from dj
Keep them on standby zach
is that a possibility
because we might have 16
jeff said he is coming
so with jeff we are at 16
I mean 14*
shuemann and josh would make 16
so cancel the standby, we need them for 4v4v4v4
But they probably won't want to play very long right?
so we should look for more to replace them when they leave.
Tyson Amundsen
Collin makes 15
Edward Ekstrom
Alright so just Josh zach
he will stay longer
Tyson Amundsen
I vote we get Dane for 16
Merit is that possuble?
Or Connor. Make it a family matter
Edward Ekstrom
Someone make a facebook event
and a google+ event
That way people will be getting notifications on their phones.
Tyson Amundsen
And a hashtag
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, I have gotten perfect scores on multiple quantitative reasoning sections of practice GREs.  Pray that I continue my success
That will make tomorrow all the more glorious.
Merit Egan
Dane and connor have both never played Halo
Tyson Amundsen
What?????
Merit Egan
Is Jeff really coming??
Edward Ekstrom
Yes
Merit Egan
I thought he was in Price
Tyson Amundsen
I bet they could beat kevin
Edward Ekstrom
He is?
Merit Egan
He was going to Price on Wednesday and coming back Thursday evening, hopefully in time for Chronic
#worklyfe
John Sherwood
Only Josh. Not shoeman.
Merit Egan
Yes, there will be no tweets of this party
I don't want to be misrepresented
John Sherwood
Because I didnt invite shoeman to the wedding. He'd catch on and come. And tweet
Tyson Amundsen
Josh is fun to halo with
Merit Egan
#TweetnationWithoutRepresentation
Tyson Amundsen
He'll be good
Hahaha john
And merit
Merit Egan
the tweet would be like "guns, cars, and beaches, can life get better?"
But it would be like, Halo guns, warthogs, and the beach on last resort
Ya know? just a little misleading as to what we are all doing.
Brayden Haws
I don't want to be misrepresented
He'll make people think we're all gay kidnappers who have him prisoner
zach fackrell
Hahahahahah keep em coming
Merit Egan
Or the tweet would be like "My new clothes are so dope", but it would be the suits the halo guys wear that he is talking about
Edward Ekstrom
Alright I created the google+ event
someone do facebook
Brayden Haws
So to clarify I'm bringing an xbox and Collin?
Edward Ekstrom
Yes
Merit Egan
Yes
Edward Ekstrom
tyson, go add spenny and lynn to the event
Is the event private
or does it show up on google+?
I dont know how it works
Brayden Haws
It's private
It says
Edward Ekstrom
Okay good
Who invited "riddler
"
and what is that?
Brayden Haws
Who is that?
I was just thinking the same thing
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know, I clicked it and nothing happened
I didn't invite them
Brayden Haws
Their location is like Ivory Coast
Tyson Amundsen
Haha you idiots
Spenny and reed eddy, spenny and reed
Edward Ekstrom
Haha invite them
on google plus
Jared
I see you.
Why aren't you coming?
John Sherwood
So we'll have 16?
Merit Egan
Who's in Sandy and wants to go to Carl's Jr. for lunch? I've got lots of coupons.
Brayden Haws
Merit I'm going there for breakfast and lunch tomo
Edward Ekstrom

Haws bring or wear yours. I'll bring an XL and we can extrapolate what a large is
Brayden Haws
Noted, I'll
Bring it
Edward Ekstrom
John can you explain this to me
Points W, X, Y and Z are on a line, not necessarily in that order.  The distance between W and X is 2, the distance between X and Y is 4, and the distance between Y and Z is 9.  Which of the following could be the distance between X and Z?
3, 5, 7, 9, or 11
Merit Egan
5
Edward Ekstrom
Good merit
I just figured it out.  I was thinking it could be 13 but since that is not a choice it makes sense..
Only 5 is possible
Merit Egan

13 could be correct as well if it was an option
Edward Ekstrom

I also got this one wrong.
Explain it to me
Brayden Haws
Is that the right answer?
Or what you guessed?
Edward Ekstrom
That's what I guessed
wrong answer
Merit Egan


Edward Ekstrom
Process of elimination?
Is there a better way?
Merit Egan
Haha probably
Edward Ekstrom

What are the four ordered pairs?
(1,1),(1,2),(2,1) and ?????
John Sherwood
Whoa math voxes. I like it. I'm driving right now. I'll show you the whays once I'm home
Edward Ekstrom
Okay

This one too.
Just kidding, I got that one.
John Sherwood
(3,1)
Here's a hint on the exponential one... 6 can be written as 2 x 3
No calculator needed
Edward Ekstrom
Got it
Wow how did I not see 3,1
Merit Egan
so you would rewrite it as (2^14)(3^14) on top and then cross out some shiz
?
Edward Ekstrom
Good John you would dominate the math part of the GRE
John Sherwood
Ya. Cross that shiz out

Alert: Seth is in Sandy
Who is partying tonight
Quick feef later merit? Or do you need to do married things to be in good graces for tomo
Merit Egan
I cannot feef tonight because my brother ran off to st. George with 4 controllers. I have 1, only 1 at my house.
So I guess I could play. But you, no. You could watch.

I'm so freakin excited
It's gibberish
Merit Egan
I had a dream last night that I got to eddy's and only Haws showed up. Me, Eddy, and Haws. Then, eddy turned into a murderer and was secretly killing a lot of people, and I knew about it, so then I was faced with the dilemma of ratting him out or not.
#realdream
So, everyone better come tonight, or Eddy will turn into a mass murderer
John Sherwood
I'll come. At 545
To create a player

Has anyone asked swearing josh?
Merit Egan
Is Collin coming?
Tyson Amundsen
I'll check your math
Merit Egan
Collin would make 13 certains
Edward Ekstrom
I'm texting josh now
Who wants to go early and make sure all the xboxen are set up and working?
Brayden Haws
Collin is coming
Merit Egan
I can be there between 5:30-5:45. But I don't really know how to set them up. #PS3-4-Lyfe
Edward Ekstrom
Sweet
Brayden Haws
Me and Collin will come at like 530 to set up
Edward Ekstrom
Josh said he is in Provo but he can probably make it up.
Merit Egan
What is DJ's probability? and how early would he be there?
Edward Ekstrom
He hasn't responded to anything so I would say low prob
Brayden Haws
I wouldn't count Stevie cause he'll be quite late
Merit Egan
OK, so we need to lock in a 14th person so we at least have 2 teams of 4
Yeah, stevie is not in the 13
Tyson Amundsen

Hard to see, but that's my back sweat mark
#tennis
Brayden Haws
Gross
Edward Ekstrom
Nice.
Merit Egan
Tyson, you need to save your energy
Edward Ekstrom
John, you still haven't accepted on google plus
Merit Egan
If John doesn't come, I will lose my flippin mind
Edward Ekstrom
and add a guest for scott if he is coming
Tyson Amundsen
Will Scott make 14? Or did we count.him
Merit Egan
I counted scott
What are our numbers again?
Certain: Merit, Eddy, John, Tyson, Haws, Zach, Jared, Scott, Talmage, Kevin, and 2 guests with Teezer?

Certain: 12 + Collin = 13
Edward Ekstrom
Is talmage not coming
Merit Egan
he is on the list
Edward Ekstrom
oh got it
wait on google+ it says 11
plus talmage on collin and john would be 14
Merit Egan
Yes, Stevie and Josh are both on there
Edward Ekstrom
Josh said he's coming on google+
oh so you are not counting stevie
because he is coming late
got it
Merit Egan
Yeah, 8:30 is like halfway through the night
1/3
1/4
1/6
Tyson Amundsen
Nah that's only 1/4
Merits phone is waaaay faster than mine
Edward Ekstrom
so my test says it is 4 hours
so I will be done at 5:30
and it's in lindon so I will be there a bit after 6 probably.
Merit Egan
SHIIIIIIIII
Tyson Amundsen
Can we get in early
Edward Ekstrom
yea
Merit Egan
As long as everyone else is on time
Tyson Amundsen
To your house to set up
Bryan Samuelson
Today's the GRE Ed? May your hammer be mighty
Merit Egan
This is not a time for CST
Edward Ekstrom
Kevin will be there and you can go through the garage.
Merit Egan
This is a time for PST, invoked only upon the most important of events
Edward Ekstrom
my xbox is in the basement in the bottom drawer of the kitchen island down there
Brayden Haws
Merit I'll just come to your house at like 545 and then we can go and try and set it all up
Edward Ekstrom
We need to grab dj's controllers too
So stop at amy and dj's on your way over
Merit Egan
I'll be in my jersey and ready to go
Can you alert them of our controller snatching event at 5:45?
Edward Ekstrom
8015547142
I'll text her but there is her number ust in case
Tyson Amundsen
Should I try to get one more person
Merit Egan
as long as they are cool, I say yes
Edward Ekstrom
Amy will be home after 3
Brayden Haws
As long as it's not shoeman
Tyson Amundsen
I agree with both statements. I haven't talked to anyone, but I'm always willing to recruit
Merit Egan
What are the chances that Adonal Foyle writes an article on the eve of our Halo fest? This truly is a sign from above.
John Sherwood
Destiny
Brayden Haws
It's a sign
God bless Adonal
Merit Egan
He is just so in tune with the Halo Gods
zach fackrell
Halo poppets
I am also available at 5:30 for set up and player creation
John Sherwood
Scott works til 7.
Merit Egan
Shiiiiiii
We need more people
So when Scott and Stevie show up we have 16
Tyson Amundsen
Are you saying Scott and stevie will make 16?
Or we need more so that when Scott and stevie do show up we will have 16
Merit Egan
So they will make 16
At the moment we have 12. They will make 14
Tyson Amundsen
Ok. Im on the job
Merit Egan
teez, can you come with me, haws, zach and john for setup?
Tyson Amundsen
I hope so. I'm coordinating with spenny to get his box and come early
Brayden Haws
Free root beer floats today at a&w
Merit Egan
No time, Halo awaits
If someone is late because of a RBFLOAT, I'll kill em. If you have time, then get one
Brayden Haws
We'll take and order and make a womenfolk deliver them to us
Merit Egan
strippers
zach fackrell
That's when the floats come out
Brayden Haws
A stripper inside of a giant mug of rootbeer float
Like one of this cakes
Merit Egan
Can we still order one of those?
Brayden Haws
We should look into it
I'd pay for that and drink some
Merit Egan
Me too. But, I don't want it to interfere with a lot of Halo. Can we just be like, "Hey, strip quick and then go"
Brayden Haws
Like a sprint strip
One minute or less
Minute to win it
Merit Egan
Yeah, all guys like video games, boobies, and pizza. We already have 2 of those covered, so show us some boobies and get out!
Brayden Haws
If you get it done in 30 secs, you get a bonus too
Tip
And a piece of pizza
Merit Egan
haha
zach fackrell
girls at halo never mix.
although we never tried adding the striping element in high school
Merit Egan
I'm willing to try. I found their website. www.rootbeerstripperbabe.org
jk, nobody click on it
the real website is
www.chicksinrootbeer.net
jk again
Brayden Haws
Clicked em both and was pleasantly surprised
Merit Egan
That rootbeer really exfoliates their skin
Edward Ekstrom
Someone go grab the paddles
From Amy's
zach fackrell
I'll go get those
John Sherwood
En route
zach fackrell
Do we need to grab halo 3 from any too??
Amy
Edward Ekstrom
No
Unless spence doesn't have it
I think he does though

Bryan Samuelson
Haha I'm glad you guys enjoyed it. Great picture haws
Merit Egan
What's the trick with these?

Edward Ekstrom
I remember there being a trick but I don't remember what it was.  I think you hold one in each hand like you are doing with the 1 and somehow interlock the closed circles.
It's magic, it can't be explained.

John Sherwood
Gaayay yagdren
Merit Egan
Friends, would anyone be interested in a provo river tubing extravaganza tomorrow afternoon? Perhaps 2ish?
Brayden Haws
Sign me up! Nothing sounds more enjoyable than a day on the river with my friends, Merit.
John Sherwood
I am in. I wish ju could come though.
Merit Egan
Does she work?
John Sherwood
Always
Merit Egan
haha
Brayden Haws
John you guys still going to JJ tomo night?
John Sherwood
Yup. That's the plan at least. So just s couple hour trip to provo tomorrow ya?
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's what I'm thinking
Merit Egan
Yeah I think just try to get there around 1,2, or 3 so the sun is still nice and hot. Tube the river and then cruise home.
Probably better/hotter/and more suitable for a concert later if the tubing starts between 1 and 2
Brayden Haws
What if we left at one, so we could be tubing by two and then head home at like 430?
Merit Egan
I reckon that will work
Brayden Haws
Enjoy the sun and take a couple of trips down
John Sherwood
I like it. I dint have a tube
Tyson Amundsen
I support this plan, tho I will be at work. Erstwhile its a beautiful day outside. Perfect temp

I only got one screen out here tho
Merit Egan
I've got enough tubes for a group the size of HaloFest 2014 JohnBachHalo
#hellohalo
I think we need to do a Call of Duty party night soon.
#hellocod
Tyson Amundsen
Haws weren't you spearheading baseball tomo?
Brayden Haws
Because that takes a lot of people which I don't think we'll get and tubing would be more fun
Merit Egan
And hey, if tubing doesn't work, why can't we play some mid morning feef/halo/Callofduty
Brayden Haws
I'd feef
Tyson Amundsen
I'd like an in depth analysis and breakdown of the Chronic Terror game. Use the canzerrzz if necessary. Spare no detail
Merit Egan
Well, is what a shiz fest. That is every detail that is needed.
For some reason the ref hated Asians and our team. There was seriously some big time discrimination against John.
I'm a little surprised we all actually stayed to the end of the game. I kind of wish we would have just sat down and called the game based on how he was officiating
Tyson Amundsen
That bad?
Merit Egan
It was pretty terrible. When a ref yells shut up at you, you know he's got something up his butt
probably an old pickle
John Sherwood
Ya it was pretty ridiculous. We have proof of anticipating calls and reffing on emotion. Two terrible qualities of a ref.
He fouled me and Scott out on the same play
Scott stole the ball (a foul of course) and while they were shooting free throws, called a foul on me.
Petty blatant
Brayden Haws
What was the foul for? Standing there?
Being alive?
John Sherwood
Intent of tripping
As the shot went up I lifted my foot in front of the guy next to me. Intending to trip him apparently
Brayden Haws
Bogus
That's like calling a foul for elbowing because you were swinging your arms while you ran
Jeff Knudsen
Watch out for the true way I run, Haws... I swing my arms in a punching motion occasionally
Brayden Haws
You're dangerous Jeff, they should ban you from the league all together
Merit can we get a percent likelihood of tubing? Me and the wife are fully committed
Tyson Amundsen
Chicken strips and donuts. They sure know their audience
Merit Egan
I hope colby is having fun doing it on sunset drive.
Also, I'd tube if we can get commitment from the group
John Sherwood
I'm committed
zach fackrell
I'll commit
Jeff Knudsen
Uncommitted
Tyson Amundsen
Discommitted
Also where is that? There is a sunset blvd everywhere
Merit Egan
Jamaica
zach fackrell
Lol
John Sherwood
If we have 100% commitment, ju will try and get work off.. What do you say?
Brayden Haws
That makes me even more committed
zach fackrell
I'm 50% ish
Tyson Amundsen
Check out @JeremySchumann's Tweet: https://twitter.com/JeremySchumann/status/497928628794322945
John Sherwood
Not once has someone picked a fight with me.
Brayden Haws
But John you're not an extreme adventurer so why would they need to
John Sherwood
You're right. No xtreme adventures for me. Also, why follow a dude(tte) who picked a fight with you?
Brayden Haws
Maybe to learn his habits so you can jump him at a later time?
Or more likely because you have a crush on him
Merit Egan
I'm committed. 100%. We can go us 6, and if more can come... great
John Sherwood
Shall we make it official?
Brayden Haws
Officialize it cap'n
(Poor cap'n crunch parody)
Merit Egan
If she can't get work off, we won't go. If she can... we will!
Bryan Samuelson
Guys that last Schumann tweet is the worst
Ok it's not as bad as thought, i misunderstood it at first glance. But still
John Sherwood
She can't get work off
Merit Egan
OK, we'll play it by ear tomorrow. If we can get more people committed, let's do it. Otherwise, swim time? Fifa time?
Brayden Haws
I'd swim as well, and feef
1. tube
2. Swim
3. Feef
That's my priorities
Jeff Knudsen
I could do #'s 2 and 3.  Haws, I need you to do physical therapy on my kankle
John Sherwood
I'll be in for all
Brayden Haws
Jeff I'm at your service
What happened
Jeff Knudsen
You'll find out shortly, I'll send you a pic

Hello bretheren. Good to be back on the vox. About to board our flight back to the US of A.

Breaking news, Katie Harris just got engaged to a kid from her mission. Tyson you called that one
Brayden Haws
Whoa Colby get of here and get back on your wife
Merit Egan
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Haha Haws that was one of the all time great voxes
Dude Colby, her fiancee is a total noob. Coulda been me
The Crawdad tagged her tho. Ayoooo.
Brayden Haws
Good work crawdad
Her fiancé is weird, met him and reported him as spam on twitter
Colby Condie
Yes Tyson. Could have been and should have been
Yes way to be Crawdad. You boomed and banged her back in the day
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Check out @JeremySchumann's Tweet: https://twitter.com/JeremySchumann/status/497934326097776640
Here's the morning #shoetweet
Brayden Haws
Tyson how good will Jaime be? #teezrsportstakes
And freak shoeman
John Sherwood
Ha shoeman
Trrble
Tyson Amundsen
Big news. Jaime should be really good. I'd expect him to slowly acclimate. Probably very little this season, but a lot next season. Big investment in him. Joao will need a lot more money next year. I think Findley will get the short end of this stick
John Sherwood
Who's jaime?
Brayden Haws
Joao is big time, saw some things on him yesterday that with a lot of stats him and Javi should be MVP candidates
I'm pretty sure it said Joao creates the most chances per touch league wide
Jaime is an Argentinian that RSL just signed as our designated player
John Sherwood
I like Argentineans
Brayden Haws
Tyson what does signing him mean for sabo?
Tyson Amundsen
It's interesting. The tribune has some good lagerway quotes about how signing him as a DP is still consistent with the Team is the Star mantra. MLS has weird financial policies and signing him that way made him impact the cap less? Idk.
As for Sabo, my thoughts regarding him are the same thoughts I have for most everyone. I really like almost all of our players and I wouldn't want to move anyone.
On the other hand, if you are able to add better players to the team, why would you not do it?
For Sabo the Jaime signing means nothing. Sabo is still the guy. He is the best forward in RSL history, scores a ton, is a great finisher, and has amazing goals per 90 numbers. I love Sabo
I do wonder how you get playing time to Jaime, Sabo, and Joao. Joao is becoming too good to sit the bench. He is still only 21 tho. Hopefully we get back to champs league so everyone has game time
I would expect Findley to be gone in the expansion draft to Orlando or NYCFC
Bryan Samuelson
Just play all forwards. Goals on goals. 1-1-8
Tyson Amundsen
Also, we've been scouting Jaime since 2012 with Kreis. Which means he is ok by me
Haha yes Bryan
Brayden Haws
Haha Bryan
Cause as far as cap goes, the DS doesn't count against the cap right? Thus Seattle able to give demps big money
But I guess my sabo question was more that, how do we get them all playing time?
RSL is awesome, god bless them
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah Idk how it will work out. It scares me that we have too many players I want to play but you can't put everyone on the field at once
Example: I wish Velasquez was getting more time
Brayden Haws
True, I feel like he never plays anymore
Tyson Amundsen
I love mulholland, but he and Gil are competing
It's tough to coach
Have you noticed Stertzer has been getting more minutes this year?
Brayden Haws
Yeah, which I suppose is good for his development, but I'd rather see Gil in the midfield
We just have too many players
Also it's a beautiful day, we should do some kind of friend activity
Merit Egan
Swim? Tube? Party?
Brayden Haws
I'd do any and all
John Sherwood
I'd do any and all. What a day. On a day like this i just have to say "kissy faces are deceiving"
zach fackrell
What up guys.
Wanna come swim??!
Yes?
Alright
(Kissy face)
Brayden Haws
Yeah Zach
what time?
John Sherwood
Let's tennis, catch, spike ball then swim. Get hot get cool.
zach fackrell
Noon meeting time? 1:00?
Brayden Haws
I'll bring my glove
And some foot guards
John Sherwood

Copy and paste Robert Frost quotes
John Sherwood
Consta tweet
En route to zachs
Merit Egan
That last tweet directly contradicts with this one.
Colby Condie
Exactly merit. We've found a flaw in the shoeman tweets.
Merit Egan
A routine is familiar, so lethal, but you are supposed to find beauty in it. Get your story straight
John Sherwood
Boom roasted
Merit Egan
Also, I had to scroll back soooooo far too find that, and it was only like 2 weeks ago. #9tweetsaday
zach fackrell
Ha hahahahaha awesome find
John Sherwood
Merit are you going to z"s?
Colby Condie
Yeah he thinks that if he tweets enough then people will forget about his previous tweets
zach fackrell
Someone should call him out in that.

And by "someone" I mean Tyson
John Sherwood
If you did it zach, he may listen. If tzr does it, he'll just snappy tom back
Tyson Amundsen
Correct john
Bryan Samuelson
Haha snappy tom. But then he might do a snappy tom tweet, which would be funny
Merit Egan
Be there in 7
Merit Egan
Guys hurry up and get here. It's getting weird.
John Sherwood
I don't think friendship is a weird thing at all merit. I think it's a beautiful phenomenon
Brayden Haws
If that's wrong then I don't know what right is
Tyson Amundsen
Haha awesome
I believe I have raised this subject before, but is anyone available to party? Quick Carls Jr or Navajo Hogan Haws
Merit Egan
I can party at 8:30ish. I'd like to watch RSL.
You guys are right, it's just friendship, and it is beautiful.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha great gif. It'd need to be recorded if we were to watch it that law
Merit Egan
Just assisting bsam's latest insta.
So real looking, it just might be real.
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha yes Merit. I edited that out so as not to seem boastful, but Xcerpt can handle the truth

Edward Ekstrom
So what's the camping sitch this weekend? Is it a hike camp or a park your car camp. We will attend if it is the latter but Annie is to pregnant for the former.
Merit. I would love to come to that but we already have family dinner plans..
Merit Egan
No problem quite a low key event. Not black tie. Well, maybe black tie.
Brayden Haws
Park the car camp
Colby Condie
Merit at your house for the BBQ?
John Sherwood
We'll come to the bbq
Merit Egan
Yes my house
Tyson Amundsen
I doubt I'll make it to the bbq but congrats merit!
you're a cool dude
Eddy we are just gonna get a site in little cottonwood to dutch oven or something and sleep in a tent. Just like the pioneers
Tyson Amundsen
IMPORTANT: Spenny and Reed want me to pitch #hellohalo this week. Since Johns wedding, Thursday would be the only option I think so maybe we should delay it
But I would also like to do it again
Brayden Haws
Screw camping lets do that
John Sherwood
Next week I'm available for #hellohalo
Brayden Haws
Wednesday night John?
Merit Egan
Post wedding, but only if John comes.

Tyson Amundsen
Oh nice. Reading his column is undoubtedly the best part of Monday every week. I'll read it at work today
Brayden Haws
Haha just saw the RSL highlights, best part on schuler header goal, Dunseth says " and he rises up like a salmon"
Merit Egan
When Schuler scored his 2nd goal, his celebration was playing it cool and saying to everyone who came to celebrate "Did that count?" It looked like he said that multiple times, insinuating that it was too easy. #D.C.Ununited
Brayden Haws
I love RSL
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yeah Haws, dunseth is a great commentator. Bill Riley is good too. Merit thanks for the lip reading skills, I couldn't figure out what he was saying but now I know
Brayden Haws
I lol'ed at Dunseth and schuler
Merit Egan
I mean, that's what it looked like to me. It is unconfirmed what Schuler said.
Brayden Haws
Merit I believe you're right
Also who has my hats? Jared?

John Sherwood
Hey boys, tomorrow at the wedding dinner, can someone say some pleasant things about me and ju? Preferably one but two at most. Whomever is feeling good and feeling gr8.
Preferably one person but two at most. Preferably say more than one thing
Bryan Samuelson
I can. I'll say a minimum of
two things
Brayden Haws
"Good Bryan, let your anger fuel you, give into the darkside" -Tyson
John Sherwood
Swizz. Or a flash mob. Ya know when the office sings to Michael? That's be cool
Jk whatever you want sman
Bryan Samuelson
Haha a flash mob would be real nice. About how long are you thinking, just a couple minutes?
John Sherwood
Ya couple minutes
Tyson Amundsen
took the words right outta my mouth Haws
Bryan I'll help. I'll stand in the back holding your speech on posters
And I'll scroll thru them as you go
Who needs technology when you have friends
Bryan Samuelson
Perfect
Colby Condie
And I'll hold the microphone for you Bryan
Bryan Samuelson
As long as you don't use a TelePrompTer. Those can break, and then the weather man is dead happens
Brayden Haws
Bryan I have already prepared your speech, just read this word for word
This is another day of solemn decision in Italy’s history and of memorable events destined to give a new course to the history of continents.

The powers of the steel pact, Fascist Italy and Nationalist Socialist Germany, ever closely linked, participate from today on the side of heroic Japan against the United States of America.

The Tripartite Pact becomes a military alliance which draws around its colors 250,000,000 men determined to do all in order to win.

Neither the Axis nor Japan wanted an extension of the conflict.

One man, one man only, a real tyrannical democrat, through a series of infinite provocations, betraying with a supreme fraud the population of his country, wanted the war and had prepared for it day by day with diabolical obstinacy.

The formidable blows that on the immense Pacific expanse have been already inflicted on American forces show how prepared are the soldiers of the Empire of the Rising Sun.

I say to you, and you will understand, that it is a privilege to fight with them.

Today, the Tripartite Pact, with the plenitude of its forces and its moral and material resources, is a formidable instrument for the war and a certainty for victory.

Tomorrow, the Tripartite Pact will become an instrument of just peace between the peoples.

Italians! Once more arise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Colby Condie
Haws is that Mussolini?
Brayden Haws
Yes
Tyson Amundsen
On my phone I would have had to type that in. Mad respect Haws
Brayden Haws
Typed it from memory
Colby Condie
Typed it from memory in 60 seconds flat
Jared Carter
Guys I do have your hats. They are safe and protected somewhere. . .
Colby Condie
Jared just don't give them to Todd Furness. He'll sell them to china and flip 'em for profit
Jared Carter
Also would anyone want to clean the temple tomorrow with zach from 2-4
I will certainly not give them to Todd he will probably start some pyramid scheme and I will be forced to participate for the lust of quick wealth.
Never mind about the temple guys. It was only a test. Your all going to H E double hockey sticks.
Brayden Haws
Jared I work or I'd love to serve god and help Zach
Bryan Samuelson
I also work Jared
zach fackrell
Jared are you serving The Lord with me tomorrow?

It just said Orlando scandrick from the cowboys was the 21st of 104 players suspended for use of it
Edward Ekstrom

John, Bryan and I are going to do the honors of talking tonight.
Is there an exact time limit?
Lower and upper bounds?
Colby Condie
During the speech, you just use these three key words at some point:

Fish
Bootstrap
Computer
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy just talk til you are done. The best strategy
I'm sure we have a big tent
John Sherwood
No time limit. Not too long though
Merit Egan
They have a robotic sniper set up at the back of market street. If you go over the unknown time limit, someone will die every 9 seconds.
Edward Ekstrom
I was thinking 45 minutes to an hour. Too short?
#highCouncelor
#gramdpaPrayers
Colby Condie
Eddy that's it? I was fully expecting at least 2 hours
And then 2 hours for Bryan
Edward Ekstrom
Perfect
Merit Egan
There's gonna be a lot of dead people after 2 hours each
John Sherwood
Sweet. Sounds good. Also, it's a casual night. No ties needed
Tyson Amundsen
I won't be dead. I invoke the right of oarlay
Parlay
John Sherwood
Also after dinner we should possibly watch ReAl?
Bryan Samuelson
Oooh, I daresay that's a ReAl good idea
Tyson Amundsen
I'm in. Record it at to casa Colb? I'll make sure its on TV
Colby Condie
I'll see if I can record it at my house. Our apartment has no TV right now
Brayden Haws
I'd watch real, no doubt I would
So John casual tonight, and what do we wear tomo?
John Sherwood
Casual tonight. Tomorrow at the temple just shirt and tie. Then at the reception/ceremony we have ties and stuff. White shirts and condie pants for reception
Brayden Haws
Cool
Colby Condie

Is this shoeman's car?
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Brayden Haws
John do you want short or long sleeve shirts at the reception?
Also colb
John Sherwood
Either shirts. Whatever you guys want
Brayden Haws
I guess the real question is do you want us all wearing the same kind?
John Sherwood
I think long sleeved should suffice
Brayden Haws
Good it will be done
Colby Condie
yes it will
Tyson Amundsen
The bad news: RSL isn't on tv. Unless there is a random online stream somewhere
Radio only
Colby Condie

I felt like I was eating a tortilla full of white rice and nothing else
Tyson Amundsen
How did they name it freebird world burrito?
John Sherwood
I'm on the vox boys. Wedding was awesome. Thanks to all. I love you all. Freebird sucks. #SV

Colby Condie
You took the words right out of our mouths
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah. It's just like Jurassic park
Hello john
Merit Egan
elaborate on the jurassic park comment tyson
Colby Condie
Merit should we do ESPN or yahoo fantasy football
Merit Egan
I have an account on both. I can't remember which I like better
Colby Condie
Me too. I remember one of them had a really good app for it but I don't know which one
Merit Egan
I'm thinking it's yahoo
not certain, but I think that's the one I've liked better
Brayden Haws
On Jurassic park, when that video of him is playing he says he took the works right out of his mouth
Honored for the comparison
Tyson Amundsen
http://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=iMsJe3TymqY
Idk what you are talking about Haws
I mean this video
Colby Condie
Ok I'm setting up a yahoo fantasy league
Live draft? Or offline draft?
Merit Egan
I've never done an offline draft. Is that just we do it in the vox or something and then someone just creates the teams?
Brayden Haws
Tyson that's exactly what I'm talking about
Colby Condie
I think offline is when you can just pick your players when you want. Live you have to be there at the same time. But you can set it up so the computer automatically drafts for you in the live one
Brayden Haws
Attention all adventurers and those tired of routine and those finding beauty in the routine: tomorrow night me and Teezr invite you all to join us camping. We'll be going to tanner flats, which is like 10-15 mins up little cottonwood canyon. Plan on arriving anytime after 5. I'll be there at like 430 to get a fire started and get stuff set up. For dinner we are wanting everyone to bring a tin foil dinner that we can cook in the coals of the fire, we can give you directions on how to make those if needed.

But so basically we'll have dinner once people start arriving/once the food is cooked, probably like 7ish. We'll bring stuff for s'mores as well. Then we can all just hangout around the fire and play games. In the morning we'll make pancakes for everyone.

If you wanna come please let us know so we know how much food we need/how much space to reserve. If you are coming please bring a sleeping bag and camp chair and anything else you might want (flashlights, clothes, etc).

This is gonna be way fun, so everyone better come, or I'll hunt them down and just beat em.
Edward Ekstrom
Annie and I are coming
We will arrive around 7
What time is everyone planning on coming home saturday?
Brayden Haws
We have to check out at 1
Tyson is leaving at like 10
Edward Ekstrom
Why so early?
Work?
Brayden Haws
I'd imagine most people will leave at like 10-11ish
Work
Edward Ekstrom
Okay cool
Merit Egan
Kelli and I will be coming with our dinners and will be there some of the evening. I am hunting in the morning, so I won't be sleeping up there. And if Haws tries to hunt me down, I will be armed.
Brayden Haws
Yes guys yes!!!! Everyone come
'X'cerpt Forever
Colby Condie
Lauren, Minni, and myself will be there for dinner. I want to sleep overnight real bad. It all depends on my work status on Saturday
Merit Egan
Who's Lauren?
also, do we have a friend named Brayden?
I heard someone talk about Brayden at the wedding last night...
Brayden Haws
Brayden sounds like a real idiot
Merit Egan
He must be gay, cause I kept hearing them mention his name with your name Haws.
He must have his eye on you
Bryan Samuelson
I'll be arriving at about 7. Probably sleeping over, unless I feel real sick
Brayden Haws
Are you sick Bryan?
I hope brayden doesn't come camping, I don't want him sleeping by me
Merit Egan
I hear he likes men's butts in jeans, so nobody wear jeans camping
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan man you aren't sick. You partied like a boss yesterday
Merit Egan
I saw zach doing some crazy dance moves. I also saw haws doing some crazy dance moves
Brayden Haws
We were getting real wild
It was enjoyable

They must've practiced the dip

John Sherwood
Yes I'm at work. Half day tomorrow
Brayden Haws
John I hate your manager
Merit Egan
Are you guys going to midway/parkcity tomorrow?
John Sherwood
Ya we are. I hate my manager too. She's divorced and doesn't want happiness and fertility
Merit Egan
haha
Brayden Haws
Shes a murderer of love
Merit Egan
She was probably on the committee that named your company. Everyone wanted to name it fertility and she was like NOOOO! let's just call it Fidelity.
Brayden Haws
Haha merit, outstanding
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Colby Condie
Hahaha
Edward Ekstrom
Your manager sucks.  I've never heard of that.
Colby Condie
Yeah I don't care what company it is.. You should always get time off for a wedding
And honeymoon
Tyson Amundsen
Let's toilet paper her
Colby Condie
And fork her lawn. And egg her car. And chew gum and stick wads on her car handles
And super glue the windshield wipers down

Why did it say I was just calling the whole population of India?
Tyson Amundsen
Guys who wants to play?
Who wants to go camping tonight?
I GOTCHA FOR THREE MINUTES!!!
Edward Ekstrom
We're coming
Merit Egan
haha haws just calling 340 million people
I'm appearing at the campsite. Unknown and unlikely that I'll sleep over
Brayden Haws

Merit you should be appearing here
Merit Egan
You guys went to Carl's Fudging Jr!
Brayden Haws
Merit we called you
Tyson Amundsen

Sound economic judgement led us here
Merit Egan
ahhh yeah I've used one of them before. Let's go again next week
So Dane got a free smart watch, but he already had one, so he gave it to me. #FreeSwag
Colby Condie
That's sweet. Is it useful?
Edward Ekstrom
Is it cool?
Merit Egan
It's cool. Not way way useful. It has some good functions. I makes me a believer in future versions, but I wouldn't pay much money for this one.
Brayden Haws
Eddy will you guys bring some marshmallows? That's all we didn't get
Colby Condie
Guys I'm trippin balls laughing at this video:

http://youtu.be/8PVal8Fy7CM
Brayden Haws
Haha colb how did you find that?
Colby Condie
Hahaha a friend from my mission sent it to me
Brayden Haws
guys were effedc
i have just been to both big and littlecottonn wood and they are all full
i vote that we go up to like ledgemere or birchwood and at least have dinner and a fire and smores and stuff
Tyson Amundsen
No way they are full everywhere
Brayden Haws
i went to tanner flats and albion basin
Tyson Amundsen
I expressed fears but didn't believe it.
Did you go up to albipn basin
big has spruces and redman
Brayden Haws
then i drove all the way to the top of big to redmen and stopped at all the ones on the way down
Tyson Amundsen
Well fu
Im not giving in
Let's sleep in my backyard
Or another locale
The launch pad
Edward Ekstrom
WTF
What are we going to do?
Brayden Haws
i confirmed with the host what i had said to you tyson, that the reason they do reservations only way far in advanced is because the camp host gets those delievered to them, they dont like have a computer or anything to look at
albion and redmen arfe both walkup only right now and they were both full from people who were already staying or who got there today before us
Edward Ekstrom
Is there a place out by the Great Salt Lake where we could just camp
and no one would charge us or care?
Brayden Haws
maybe, you have to pay on antelope island
Edward Ekstrom
I am fine with paying
but I wonder if they're full too..
Brayden Haws
the real prob ed is that there is no technologies and in the case of the canyons not even phones so the only way to check availiabilty is to just show up
thus our current situation
the website showed tons of walkups open but when we got there they were all full
Edward Ekstrom
This sucks.
How do they not even have phones.
Brayden Haws
well im sure the hosts have cell phones but those arent on the website
theres just like a general info line you can call but they dont/cant tell you about open sites
just like about the fees and where campgrounds are and stuff
Edward Ekstrom
Wow.
Okay so what is our plan then?
Brayden Haws
im mad cause i drove far and my phone died and there was nothing
Edward Ekstrom
I'm sincerely sorry.
Let's go diamond cut their aaaas
Brayden Haws
i would vote we at least go to a picnic site and have dinner and fires and stuff til they kick us out
or camp at tysons house
like small children
which would be fun
Edward Ekstrom
801-483-6705
haws can you try this number
it's called Affleck park
parley's canyon
I'll try it
give me a sec
They're full..
Brayden Haws
im checking east canyon right now
Edward Ekstrom
This is the gayest
Yeah that is far enough away that I feel like is should be available..
Brayden Haws
its full
Edward Ekstrom
Oh Fuh.
Brayden Haws
shi bag
tyson any other areas we can look at?
Edward Ekstrom
My dad is out of town.
If we want to swim and bbq our shi then we could do that.
Brayden Haws
i would do that if we cant find anything else
fol guys
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, first priority is camping.
Brayden Haws
f our lives
Edward Ekstrom
Jordanelle
there's a couple camp grounds there..
I feel like those might be full.
Brayden Haws
im checking
Edward Ekstrom
Or rockport
That might be more likely.
Brayden Haws
tent sites are full at jordan
Merit Egan
would anyone be open to my provo cabin? We could have a fire, maybe tube tomorrow. I'd have to check availability.
Brayden Haws
only picnic areas
merit id love that
Edward Ekstrom
Id be totes down with that
Brayden Haws
these are my thoughts, if merit can lets go to the cabin
Edward Ekstrom
Agreed.
Brayden Haws
if not lets go up big cotton and have a fire and dinner and then swim at eds
Edward Ekstrom
Alright
Brayden Haws
if not that then lets just commit group suicide cause theres no point in living
Edward Ekstrom
Deal
Brayden Haws
i feel at this point if were not camping in a back yard were not camping anywhere
Tyson Amundsen
Funny interjection: I'm reading comments to a Freeskier Society survey we made. One question was like "what activities would you like the club to do"
One kids response:
"Gang bangs at a fear house or at Snowbird. I just wanna get some"
Brayden Haws
haha thats great
tyson what say ye about tonight?
also gangbangs
gang bangs
gong bangers
Tyson Amundsen
Frat house
I'll find a site
Is midway too far?
Kansas is only 53 minutes
Kamas
Brayden Haws
i feel like if were willing to go  to merits cabin thats not too far
but at this point it has to be guaranteed theyll be a spot cause we cant have everyone drive that far for mothing
Tyson Amundsen
Haws go to fs.usda.gov
It has maps of sites
I'm checking availability
#gangbangs
Try yellow pine.campground
It's an hour away exactly
Brayden Haws
no reservations allowed there
Tyson Amundsen
Can you call them
Of course we can't reserve at thia point
Brayden Haws
all the wasatch-cache camps have the same number for the rangers
Tyson Amundsen
Ask how many sites are still available
Brayden Haws
i tried to just call for the lower provo but they said there are no phones there at the actual camp so they have no way of knowing whats available without physically going there
Tyson Amundsen
Poop. I'm not super surprised that all cottonwood canyon is packed. But I would be if out there was. That one time when me and Seth went with Clayton Alexander, urban Meyer, and the goblin we had no reservation
We just cruises out and found a spot
There are a lot of campgrounds
Brayden Haws
yeah im sure they have open spots at one of the campgrounds
but wheres really the problem
im sure any like strawberry and others that have boat access will be full
what weve learned here is that we should just make a reservation like a month in advance, which will be less flexible
but whoever can go will just have to go
Tyson Amundsen
I've long believed that
Merit Egan
What is the roll call for tonight? The cabin could be a good possibility.
Tyson Amundsen
But I never say never
I'll still go, and I'll drive
Brayden Haws
i never say never either tyson
Tyson Amundsen
I dont care
We go to kamas
And we will find a spot
Or we sleep naked in the woods
Brayden Haws
but i also dont want to end up just driving from camp ground to camp ground all night
Tyson Amundsen
We can't lose
It would be like a road trip if it came to that. I'll tell stories and run over deer
It'll be fun
And i bet $10 we get in to the first 1 or 2 campgeounds
I'm committed. I really think the worst scenario is we spend Friday night Not watching television
Edward Ekstrom
I'm down with Merit's cabin or looking for a campground.
Merit Egan
If you want a safer option, my cabin is available. My family is coming up there tomorrow around noon or 1, but before then, it is wide open.
if you want to camp, so be it
I rest my case.
In the hands of the eternal Teez shall we hear of the decision
Edward Ekstrom
Don't wrest the scriptures.
Or you'll burn your a** in hell.
So says the Good Book.
Amen.
Okay camping or the cabin?
We need to decide people
It's almost time to leave.
Brayden Haws
Yeah kasey is on her way home
She's ready to go right then
Tyson when does your work end?
Merit Egan
I can be on the road by 5:30
Edward Ekstrom
I will be ready to get on the road at about 6
Tyson Amundsen
I get off at 650. And I would vote we search in kamas/Kansas
Merit I'm glad you are still in
Brayden Haws
For Tyson's plan I feel that we should all meet before hand
Tyson Amundsen
I will do whatever, but hats my vote
Brayden Haws
So we don't have us, ekstrom a, Egans, condies, Bryan and Jeff all in different vehicles driving so far
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
Should I bring my handgun or my shotgun?
or both?

Initiating twitter battle...
He didn't take the bait, failure to launch
Bryan Samuelson
I saw that, a remarkably benign response
Edward Ekstrom
Thought I was driving next to Beckerman....

John Sherwood
Yo boyz, Sherwoods reporting for duty. Back from midway. What a fun getaway. This week I'll probably be out for #hellohalo. But this coming Saturday we can get tix to RSL. We can get up to 14 tix for 15 each. Date night? Who's in? We need to know by tonight.. #7xangos
Merit Egan
We are a no go for RSL
Bryan Samuelson
Welcome back man, glad to hear it was a good time. I'd like to be in for Saturday. I'll find a date, by hook or by crook
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen

John Sherwood

Sam Jensen got married?
Tyson Amundsen
Haha

It was a non temple wedster
Brayden Haws
You put she got engaged
Tyson Amundsen
A small stir in ward council it created
Brayden Haws
But that wasn't that long ago I feel
Is she still Mormon?
Is she prego?
Edward Ekstrom
I could see that.
Merit Egan
To Brandon Prince?
Never liked him. Not one bit.
If you look up D bag in the dictionary, chances are, you'd see a picture of Hitler, Brandon Prince, and Gomez
Brayden Haws
Haha merit
I lol'ed
Like it
Merit Egan
haha, a little extreme? I think not
He tried to fight me in Eddy's drive way playing basketball once
Like I was gonna tarnish my good name fighting that d bag. You don't bet your house in exchange for a chinese finger trap
Edward Ekstrom
yeah he was not cool
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think she is pregnant. She is fairly Mormon, but clearly not super Mormon
Check out @RSLTotalMLS's Tweet: https://twitter.com/RSLTotalMLS/status/501355398637436929
Meanwhile, RSL is in solid position to have the best record in the league and win the supporters shield
Bryan Samuelson
Brandon Prince definitely had some d-bag tendencies, but I thought he was a changed man post mission. I was saddened to see they didn't get married in the temple
Gooood RSL
Merit Egan
I remember you saying that he had changed. Hopefully he has. And hey, as long as they make it to the temple at some point. AMARIGHT?
or is it AMIRIGHT

Edward Ekstrom
Hey boys, is anyone available tomorrow afternoon for one hour to help me move a tv and some furniture? It will be max an hour. All it is is moving around furniture that is already in the garage to a new place in the garage and the tv isn't heavy it's just big.
Brayden Haws

Or you'd have my ax
Edward Ekstrom
One hour any time from noon until 5

Haws I like that app. Great memory
Reunion tour tonight?
Merit Egan
I'd like to, but I feel that Hector's has lost it's mojo
I eat there now and am deeply saddened by the tastes and the spices.
Betos and Rancheritos are now a step ahead in my book
Tyson Amundsen
I'm good with the tastes and spices, its the portions that are lessened.
I would go. Merit me and Bryan will pick you up tonight and go
Merit Egan
That too.
Tyson Amundsen
Rancheritos on 9400 could do
Merit Egan
I refuse. Hector has given in to the fame and glory, and left his roots behind.
Tyson Amundsen
Maybe
Just maybe
Merit Egan
Ah yes, Rancheritos
I would
Tyson Amundsen
We'll keep it on the table then. Also you should feef with me and Bryan

Give me your thoughts
Brayden Haws
I would say there is definitely proof that football is causing many neurological disorders, so in that respect they're right, it seems hypocritical for an NFL representative to be doing the challenge. But at the same time I don't think it's right to attack goodell because he is essentially an employee of the NFL owners and has to do what is best for them, so I don't feel like he should get attacked for doing his job.
If he's acting as their representative it isn't right to attack him for simply doing his job, it's not his fault if the owners are skirting trying to take responsibility for the damage to players
Merit Egan
That person is retarded. Nuf Said
He's acting like this is Marlboro donating money to cancer. Marlboro's product is heavily connected to cancer and many times is the root cause of it. The NFL does a lot of good already, and if they are supporting looking for a cure for Neurological disorders for their current players, then that's great.
The NFL is doing a lot to prevent life debilitating long term injuries, but it is a violent sport and there is only so much you can do
So I think it is very unfair to say that he is being a hypocrite. How about Dave Zirin stops watching football, because at the moment he is just as big a hypocrite as Goodell
The end
Brayden Haws
Merit your last point is spot on, it's a violent sport, players have to realize there is risk to health involved, I honestly feel like the NFL really shouldn't have to do much of anything but they are so that guy shouldn't be attacking goodell, he should be attacking himself cause he sucks
Sucks butts
Hairy butt sucker
The end
Merit Egan
haha
So my brother Winston is good friends with Reno Mahe. He told me the other day that Reno, who spent like 3 years in the league, gets pension checks for the rest of his life at $6,000 a month. So I think NFL players are happy to take the risk of maybe having some long term problems for the opportunity they would have
Last point: Only 4 former or current NFL players have been diagnosed with ALS in the last 7 years. There are 80 players on a roster and 30 teams.
Brayden Haws
Exactly merit and they get way good health insurance for life, we've had a few former players come into my work and their insurance pretty much pays for anything they or their family needs for their whole life
Merit Egan
Good haws, we are on the same page. Let's fight this guy
Tyson Amundsen
Hold everything!! Big time news gentlemen: I got another interview for med school!
Ayoooo GEORGETOWN
Merit Egan


Tyson Amundsen
Haha that's exactly right Merit!
Merit Egan
When do you interview?
John Sherwood
Holy crap tzr. Good luck. And good night
Tyson Amundsen
Thanks john! I'm scheduling it shortly. Between Sept. 30-Oct 10 are my options
I need to check airfare real quick to see when my cheapest option is
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Merit is that a joke or real?
Im to hyped up to tell
And i k ow you love oogle
Merit Egan
it just shows all the flights from all the airlines. Much easier and quicker than orbitz and kayak and all them
Tyson Amundsen
Ok good
Last year Georgetown interviewed 1300 out of 13,000 applicants
John Sherwood
How many do they accept?
Merit Egan
Those are smaller odds than getting ALS in the NFL!
If you were in the NFL, you'd have ALS twice
Alex Platis
Teeeezzrrrrrrr
I'm chalking this up to you name dropping me
But not really. Congrats.
Tyson Amundsen
They take 190
I don't know the math on that, but from start to finish its tough odds

Merit Egan

Merit Egan
Tyson show him the way. You can set your team at work on your phone in 2 minutes.
Brayden Haws
Merit my next question is this a cap league? I didn't see any sort of monies on there

Why can't I see my team on here?
Or our league?
Bryan Samuelson
I'm already in a league. Last time I did two leagues it would always end up that the people I had on my team in one league were the same people that I was going up against in the other league. I didn't like that
Brayden Haws
Bryan none of us our in your other league
Oh the players
That's fine
Merit Egan
Yeah but bsam, you can have 2 best friends
Merit Egan
Guys, we need 2 more to make 10. Tyson, join us!
Tyson Amundsen
Way to go!
Merit Egan
If I get the first pick, I'll pick a player and trade them to you.
Brayden Haws
Merit lets draft tomo, I'm not ready yet

Colby Condie

That second one is a huge gif thing of Tottenham Hotspur. They had 48 consecutive passes in a sequence for one of their goals. Amazing
Also let us rejoice in the day of salvation how poor Sporting Kansas City was this weekend. If only Portland hadn't gotten whooped by Seattle

Merit Egan
That truly is picturesque
Tyson Amundsen
Free admission til Thursday
Merit Egan
Edward you took the GRE or the GMAT recently? USU accepts either for their MBA program. So now I'm deciding which to do
Tyson Amundsen
There are a lot of guys dressed way faggy at the U today
And a lot of hotties dressed way slutty
Brayden Haws
So many sluts at the fieldhouse Tyson, that's where you need to go
Merit Egan
Why is this happening?
Is there an event, or is this just the world we live in?
Brayden Haws
It's hoes on parade merit
It's a lifelong event
Merit Egan
So just like the usual hotties dressed like sluts, and not like sluts dressed like bigger sluts
Brayden Haws
The hotties are dressed like sluts and the sluts like bigger sluts
Merit Egan
woah, so we've taken a new step?
What the sluts wore last year is what the hotties are wearing this year, and last years sluts are wearing who knows what? And who's wearing what the hotties wore last year?
Brayden Haws
I think it's the apocalypse
Also I'd like everyone to know I'm taking lifetime fitness this semester online
Online gym class
Merit Egan
Do you just play FIFA and stuff? those players get tons of exercise
Brayden Haws
Well I'm supposed to log my exercise 3x a week
And by my exercise I mean how much the FIFA plAyers exercise
And my fantasy team
Merit Egan
haha
yes, I guess we can play FIFA 3 times a week if it's for school
Brayden Haws
We have to, it's required
Brayden Haws
At this point I'm pretty sure girls have stopped wearing shorts and are just wearing denim thongs

The vox has been so quiet, I hate it
Colby Condie
too quiet
Tyson Amundsen
I can liven it up with a topic for discussion
Brayden Haws
Like did the sluts kidnap everyone?
Tyson Amundsen
Al would love that Haws
But that's not my topic
Brayden Haws
Oh I wasn't saying that as the topic but rather the reason it was so quiet
Tyson Amundsen
Ok here ya go
"Imagine you are a family physician and are seeing a 15 year old girl with menstrual cramps. Her mother has accompanied her for the visit. When you examine the patient without her mother present, she tells you that she is sexually active. She begs you not to tell her mother because of her family's strong values against teen sex. Discuss your next steps."
Kudos to Virginia Commonwealth's secondary application
Bryan Samuelson
Wow
Edward Ekstrom
Yes merit I took the gre
Bryan Samuelson
I don't have an answer yet, but I will say VCU is cool. They're basketball team is awesome, except for the time they beat Duke. But that was pre their new coach. So they're forgiven. And cool.
Brayden Haws
That is a good one Teezr
I feel like you don't tell the mom, doctor-patient privilege, the other gave you permission to treat that's all you need
Tyson Amundsen
Haws is correct. I don't like it, but that's the way it is. The laws protect the teen girl
There are some positives to it. By not breaking confidence, she will feel comfortable coming back in the future
Brayden Haws
Planned parenthood and places like that girls can get treatment even without parent permission
In some states they can even get abortions
Edward Ekstrom
Oh yeah and I bet those states even let women vote.. Disgusting
Brayden Haws
Haha I meant abortions with parental approval
Edward Ekstrom
I was being sarcastic haws. I got what you meant
Brayden Haws
Haha I know
It was funny
And that's when the whores come out
Edward Ekstrom
Guys, I'll have you know that I just spent like an hour catching up in this and voxer. I'm the best friend ever

Has anyone ever rented a textbook?
Its like $50 cheaper
Brayden Haws
I pretty much always rent them when I can
If you don't need like a software key code or anything for the class
Tyson Amundsen
And it pays return shipping. And no way I can sell Latin America and its people
Where from Haws
Anywhere?
Brayden Haws
It nice cause you can beat the shi out of it and mark it up and it doenst matter
Tyson Amundsen
Textbooks.com
Brayden Haws
I just get mine from the school bookstore, they're always way cheap
My substance abuse book was 80 less
Tyson Amundsen
Hmmm. I feel the bookstore never has rentals if what we need
Merit Egan
I always just bought the previous edition from Amazon. I only ever had 1 class where there was any difference in the book. I would get them for like $10 instead of $120
Brayden Haws
Well that sucks
Yeah merit has a great tip too
Merit Egan
In terms of medical stuff though, I don't know. Maybe you need to most recent book or you'll kill people
Brayden Haws
A lot of teachers recommend that cause they like hardly change anything, like switch a period to a comma and charge you an extra 100
In my sport nutrition class the 17th addition was the current but she let us use all the way back to the 8th cause it was pretty much the same
Merit Egan
yeah, I probably did it with 20 books, and as I said, only 1 time was there any difference. They had changed the case studies. Every other time it had all the same stuff
Brayden Haws
I was actually at the bookstore yesterday looking at a book that had two additions and the only difference mentioned in the newer one was that the photo format was changed, same photos they were just added digitally so they looked clearer, it was way lot expensive
Merit Egan
and usually you can see the table of contents online for both editions and see if it is the same
Brayden Haws
School is a joke, just take all our money for nothing
Edward Ekstrom
I just download digital copies for free
Never got caught neither
Merit Egan
I've also done that a few times
more than 3 times, less than 1,000
Colby Condie
where did you do that eddy
Brayden Haws
Remember when we got you that math book in Spanish eddy?
Tyson Amundsen
I don't have the technology to do that
Brayden Haws
All you need is bit torrent on your computer
Tyson Amundsen
But in good news, Amazon had one of my books for 38 cents
I don't know how to use torrents
Also part of me likes hard copies
Brayden Haws
Tyson man it's the 21st century, everyone knows how to use torrents
Tyson Amundsen
But ebooks are good cuz you can find words quickly
Brayden Haws
Merit taught me how to use them like 8 years ago
Tyson Amundsen
I only stream soccer illegally. They are the only trusty sites
Only a few bad pop ups
Brayden Haws
Ebooks are the best for when you have online tests, cause you can just search for the answer
Tyson Amundsen
I bet I'm not the only one here who doesnt use torrents
Brayden Haws
Bryan won't cause of ethics I would wager
Tyson Amundsen
Bingo
Also the first few days of class are way boring cuz nothing is taught. It's just syllabus and stuff
But its incredibly necessary to start that way
Brayden Haws
Just an hour of them reading the syllabus
Tyson Amundsen
Cuz you can find out if the class will be hard and what book you need and stuff
Brayden Haws
It give you great time to read twitter and prepare your mind for the learning ahead
Tyson Amundsen
I just wish there was more twitter or Google vox right now
The u plays thuesday?
Are we gonna warch?
Hey merit
Merit Egan
Teez man, how do you feel about playing basketball on Wednesday at 7 in Taylorsville. #greenthumb #tomthumb
Tyson Amundsen
Chronic?? I thought they were Thursday
As in tomo?
Merit Egan
Chronic is Thursday. But we have started another team, named Sloan's Kidzz. This was to bring eddy back to SLC. Eddy is going to miss the game tomorrow cause he gets home late.
Tyson Amundsen
Dumb eddy. Who is on it?
I have a UFS meeting at 7 desafortunadamente
So I can't
Maybe I could be a super sub
Merit Egan
well i had to dig deep for a roster. It's still in the making, but comprises of 4 egans, eddy, and brad kasteler if you remember who he is (one of dane's friends)
And everyone else in this chat is a sub
Colby Condie
who is at the U campus right now? i'm disappointed i havent seen any of my friends around here. my first day at the U
Tyson Amundsen
I'm at the union for 15 more minutes
Colby Condie
i'm now in class until 3:20
Bryan Samuelson
Welcome Colbinski! I'm currently getting Wendy's, but I have class at 3:40. Unfortunately have to book it in
Brayden Haws
I hate the U, did you guys just see the email about parking Thursday? Guardsman and the stadium are closed? You have to park in a field by the dorms?! Fuh this school
Merit Egan
I have a question for all of you, and I need honest answers. Does anyone have a Pac-12 sticker on their car?
Brayden Haws
No
Merit Egan
Addition to the question: As a fan of the U, do you think it's dumb when people do have those stickers?
Colby Condie
dude haws i took trax today. worked like a charm. i'm gonna do it everyday now
Brayden Haws
I think they are way dumb. I could see the ones that are pac12 and the U combined but just a plain pac12 is stuuiuuupid
Like lick a butt stupid
Colb how early did you wake up?
Colby Condie
5:30am.
Brayden Haws
Shitballs
Colby Condie
sucked a big wein
Merit Egan
agreed haws. Pac-12+U are somewhat acceptable. Plain Pac-12...Oregon and USC would laugh if they came here and saw those stickers
Brayden Haws
Merit you should get an independent sticker
Merit Egan
Heck yeah, and a Jimmer sticker
Colby Condie
from a general standpoint, it's good to be a fan of the conference you play in because it reflects strength of schedule, which comes into play with BCS rankings. Like SEC schools are very proud of being in the conference because it is super tough to win each week
but i agree that having the sticker and nothing else is kind of tacky
Merit Egan
Yes, I agree with that 100%. I have no issue with being proud of the conference you are in. Frankly, I would jump into a good conference in a heartbeat, and hopefully BYu can soon. I just find it really dumb to see a car with a pac-12 sticker. Many times they aren't even accompanied by a U sticker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqX_b_Bu4hI
Brayden Haws
I agree with merit and Colby, you should support your conference but a lame sticker isn't the way. If merit had and Independent sticker on his car utah fans would mock him
So the same should happen to utah fans
Merit Egan
and if BYU does get into the Big 12, I will be ashamed as soon as I see someone with a Big 12 sticker.
Brayden Haws
So far all the PAC 12 has done for the U and it's fans and student has made school way more expensive
Colby Condie
as a quick sidenote interjection, who here uses Gmail? does anyone else have the issue where emails will load on your phone several hours before your computer?
Brayden Haws
Not hours for me but minutes
Tyson Amundsen
I do and no
Brayden Haws
My phone always gets them a few minutes faster
Merit Egan
It has definitely shown that Utah, and by the transitive property, BYU, are both mediocre football programs. We appeared much better than we were in the Mountain West.
Colby Condie
theres emails on my phone that i got this morning which still havent arrived on my computer
Brayden Haws
Yeah we used to beat people's A's but now we just get kicked around
Colby Condie
one name: Urban Meyer
Merit Egan
That brings up another interesting point Colby. Let's look at this through real eyes, not Red or Blue shaded glasses. Take Utah's best seasons, undefeated with Alex Smith and Urban, and the most recent undefeated season. What would their record have been if they were in the Pac-12?
No doubt they were good teams. Over or under 10-2
Brayden Haws
Under for sure
Colby Condie
under.
no doubt
Brayden Haws
I would say senior season BJ and coach Whitt would have done better than that team
Merit Egan
So that is a little bit scary for both BYU and Utah. Take the very best team either of us have had in the last 25 years, and at best we are an 8 or 9 win team in a good conference. None of us will ever play in the college playoffs
It would take a team of destiny and then everything would have to go right
Brayden Haws
I think you're right merit. The SEC will likely put two in the PAC 12 will get one and then probably a BIG12/10 or undefeated at large
Merit Egan
yeah, it is most likely that only 3/5 power conferences will be represented in the playoffs
Colby Condie
not to be biased, but i think if you take the best team in the Pac-12 (oregon probably) and i honestly feel that in the SEC they would be a 4th or 5th ranked team in the conference. from top to bottom, there is more depth and each week is a tough big time game
Merit Egan
I agree. The SEC is so freaking good.
Colby Condie
people always get butt hurt about SEC proud fans, but they have every right to talk smack because they win and have several teams in the top 25 and even top 10 every year
Merit Egan
I honestly think Alabama could compete with the Jacksonville Jaguars
Brayden Haws
I don't think that biased at all, the SEC deserves more than one team in there cause most of their mid tier teams would just destroy if they're were in another conference
Merit Egan
both last years teams
Colby Condie
exactly haws. like georgia for example is considered a "middle teir" to "upper tier" SEC team because they don't win the conference but don't get pushed around either. but if you take those same georgia teams and stick them in the pac12 they would probably go   11-1 or 10-2 at worst each year
Merit Egan
I think Oregon, Stanford, and USC in typical years are all at about the same level as Georgia. then the SEC just has another tier.
USC is obviously have a down time
So Georgia would absolutely be a front runner in the Pac-12, but any Pac-12 front runner would fall back in the SEC.
Colby Condie
very well said merit
Merit Egan
You taught me everything I know
Edward Ekstrom
Even though we are not at the top of the pac 12 I still like it better because it is fun to watch all our games.
Merit Egan
It's too bad we couldn't kick wyoming and colorado state out of the mountain west and bring in Boise St. and USU and keep TCU. then we probably would have been the 5th best conference
Utah, BYU, TCU, Boise St. would have been a good 4
Colby Condie
and eddy that is a bonus of being in a big name conference. you get better ratings and more national attention. marketing plus
now isn't boise st in the big 10?
i can't keep track of them all
Merit Egan
I think they are still mountain west. TCU went to the big 10
or big 12
why the freak is there a conference called the big 10 and a conference called the big 12
and the big 12 has like 14 teams
Brayden Haws
And the big 12 only has 10 teams right now
Colby Condie
yeah and i think the big 10 has 12 teams now
Merit Egan
so big 10 has 14, big 12 has 10
Brayden Haws
Cause Texas am left and so did another team
Yeah the big ten has two 7 team divisions I think
Merit Egan
just looked it up, big 10=14
big 12=10
Colby Condie
yup thats right
Merit Egan
I really hope BYU can get into the Big 12 when they expand
Colby Condie
the two teams that left the big 12 went to the SEC. so there's 14 in SEC now
Brayden Haws
Texas am and who's the other colb? I can't remember
Colby Condie
missouri
Brayden Haws
Oh yeah, they're in the east right?
And am is in the west
Colby Condie
yeah. georgia has played them twice since they joined. yeah texas am is in west with bama
Colby Condie
Topic of discussion for the voxers out there: what is everyone's opinion of the word "cute" ? I feel like girls use it to the extreme. How can a dog, a couch, someone's hairstyle, and a billion other things all have the same descriptive word of "cute" with them?
Tyson Amundsen
Cute is a jack of all trades, really
zach fackrell
It's like "adventure" you can pretty much say it about everything
Brayden Haws
Haha Zach
I lol'ed
Merit Egan
Americans feel obligated to express their opinion on everything because we have freedom of speech. Thus, we have to re-use words to cover the fast amount of opinions we must share.
Tyson Amundsen
Check out @JOEL9ONE's Tweet: https://twitter.com/JOEL9ONE/status/504346186644348928
I believe this was tweeted about the Rams and Michael Sam.
I honestly forgot who drafted him
Merit, jaws, Bryan, colby weigh in?
Bryan Samuelson
I'll agree that I think it's a tad ridiculous that Michael Sam getting a sack is a big feature in sportscenter
Brayden Haws
I feel like it's a non factor if he makes it that's great for him and good on the rams for getting a roster player so late in the draft
But tons of rookies are getting sacks in the preseason, so this isn't news. I feel like espn doenst report as much on sports as they do pop culture
Bleacher report and and sbnation and even deadspin are better places to go to get actual sports info
Merit Egan
Isn't he gay?
Tyson Amundsen
Haws that's bold. Do you see any of those outlets becoming the top sports news provider? I feel ESPN is huge all over and is pretty entrenched
Brayden Haws
I think espn will always be king cause it's a household name and they carry a lot of great sports events. It's the between time of dead space where on sports center and such they need to draw in a wide audience so they only focus on a few stars or controversial figures and just report everything about them
Where as other sites, I should have said grantland as well, dog deep and do stat analysis and look at why certain player excel and what tactic work and why. Which is way interesting to people who are more than just causal fans
It's like every person in America knows lebron so they just spend half of sportscenter talking about him, because it's more likely more people who are causal fans will stayed tuned in, then if they run a feature on tiago splitter or some other role player
Merit Egan
Guys I was joking. I know he's gay. The other day they were showing highlights of him sacking Manziel and they showed it 4-5 times. It was a little odd. If it's all about treating him the same as any other player.....
Wednesday, August 27, 2014 7:16 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah that's gay.
Did he try to clutch his Wien while he sacked him?
And I hope we're talking about a football sack not some homo term.
Colby Condie
Hahaha. Or maybe he sacked him then layed on top for too long
Brayden Haws
He was trying to get him in the sack
Merit Egan
You guys are all so smart. ESPN issued an apology on the matter today. I love that another player on the Rams told ESPN that is is not a big deal after they keep trying to make it a deal.
Tyson Amundsen

Tabling with UFS across from Victoria's secret
Not upset about it
Anyone need condoms?
Bsam the athletic teainers are right next to me
Brayden Haws
Is that Ashely marz getting some condoms?
Merit Egan
hahaha haws I think you are right
Tyson Amundsen
Also true, that's her
Bryan Samuelson
Ha I thought the reason for the picture was Ashley Mars. Is Kenyon Martin with the trainers?
Tyson Amundsen
No. Another cute girl. Dressed like she wasn't cute. But I wasnt fooled
Colby Condie
Haha
Tyson I walked past the UFS tent yesterday but much to my chagrin I didn't see you
Bryan Samuelson
Colby goes to college, using words like "chagrin" and "much to my". Well played
Colby Condie
Yes Bryan
I was chagrined
Tyson Amundsen

Colby Condie

Brayden Haws
Maddie busteed
In regards to how dumb espn is, they just reported about Johnny Manziel being in a snickers commercial. How is there nothing more interesting than that to talk about?
Colby Condie
Like there are some really good pennant races going on right now in the MLB. How is an offseason marketing story of a rookie QB more important?
*division races
John Sherwood
I forgot to tell you guys!! At the temple on my wedding day I saw maddie busteed. A funny reflective time I had
Also, utes game tonight. Y game tomorrow. We are underway, boys. I love it
Colby Condie

Brayden Haws

No further argument needed

Tyson Amundsen
Haha I love life
Brayden Haws
Tyson thank you
You know I laughed at these
Brayden Haws
In local sports news, max hall got arrested in Gilbert Arizona for shoplifting from Walmart and best buy and had cocaine in his backpack
Merit Egan
"classless"
his mugshot is funny
Tyson Amundsen
Screen Shot It
Colby Condie

Merit Egan

Colby Condie
funny thing is he is wearing a BYU shirt in a mugshot
Merit Egan
#represent
Colby Condie
haha
Brayden Haws
Haha so funny
I've had dinner with him on my mission, his in-laws lived in my area, he was kinda douchey
Also his family was nuts, maybe that's why he's on drugs
Merit Egan
yeah, he was a great QB, but you can tell he was a bit cocky and probably would be best friends with Tommy Thornburg
Colby Condie
haha
haws did you intercept the salt shaker that max hall passed during that dinner
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha Colby for the win

Brayden Haws
Haha colbs
Also merit great commentary on his psyche
Merit Egan
I can't believe you all are laughing at somebody because they have a drug problem. WWJD
Max Hall was right. Ute fans are classless
Brayden Haws
Cool merit just hates us
Merit Egan
haha no haws. I was being sarcastic. I literally am joking.
I'm gonna start using literally a lot more, but in the right way.
Colby Condie
haha
Merit Egan
Example: That car is literally on wheels.
bad example: That guy is so fast, he is literally on wheels
Brayden Haws
Whatever merit
You said it jokingly
Merit Egan
F you haws, figuratively.
Brayden Haws
But also kinda said it in a way tommy thornburg would
Merit Egan
I'm sorry Brayden
Brayden Haws
Haha just kidding merit, I literally knew it was a joke
Merit Egan
How dare you leave me in the dark like that and make me apologize to your first name!
Brayden Haws
This situation literally got out of hand and for that I apologize to you for having to use my name
Brayden Haws
Merit lets talk about football and be friends
Wes welker was already out with a concussion and now he got suspended for amphetamine use
Brayden Haws
Merit lets also be friends and talk about can we go tubing again sometime
Colby Condie
Yes I want to go tubing again before it gets cold
Merit Egan
I'm friends. I'm excited for fantasy football to start up this week. Tubing would be very fun.
zach fackrell

Brayden Haws
Ziplining Zach?
I'd go
Tyson Amundsen
Let's talk about how gay the U is right now
My tuition was $3900
That's almost $1500 more than it costs at the Y or UVU
And we are getting gouged everywhere
Screw this
Colby Condie
I hate college
John Sherwood
Sheesh. Tuition is literally expensive
Merit Egan
Was there tuition differences for the classes you were in? At Usu, tuition was like 2200, but in the upper division classes there was an extra charge per credit, so is pay like 4500
Brayden Haws
I hate the U
They have no parking
Huge classes
And charge a billion dollars
Colby Condie
John that was literally funny
Merit Egan
I think that's why I left BYU. I was hating everything about it and I didn't want to jeopardize my fanhood, so I had to transfer.
Brayden Haws
Smart move merit
Cause now I just have boiling hate for utah
One thing I disliked about USU, from kaseys tuition was there was a 900 fee to take online classes
On top of the class fees
Tyson Amundsen
It all blows. I hate the U

Come soon Sabo
Brayden Haws
Praise sabo
Merit Egan
Yeah Sabo. Usu waived the online class fee now. Super gay cause it was right as I finished.
Brayden Haws
That's so dumb. Last semster my tuition was the same as kaseys even though she only had two classes
Tyson Amundsen
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS
Are you kidding me
I don't like it
Brayden Haws
Yeah cause she had fees, then her hour fees and then the online fee
Just outrageous
But luckily she got it all payed for from grants and taxes
Advantage of marriage
Tyson Amundsen
Guys USA plays Czech Republic at noon ish tomo. Whoever is gonna be at the U should watch it with me and Drew on the TV show at the library
Brayden Haws
I can do that
And would like to
Tyson Amundsen
Excellent. I think kick is at 1230. I can be there at 1250. I'll check with drew

Brayden Haws
In an update to how slutty girls are becoming, this girl flashed like half of my chem class today
Tyson Amundsen
Bumme... I mean she shouldn't do that
Brayden Haws
Unwholesome Teezr
Tyson Amundsen
#theeternalfeudhasended
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha.
Brayden Haws
Guys could we do some sat morning bball?
Merit Egan
I think we'll all have a Halo Hangover
Regardless of whether I have a hangover, I can't. Gotta go support the Mrs. as she completes her 1/2 marathon
Bryan Samuelson
I don't think this Saturday will work for me either but next Saturday?
Edward Ekstrom
Saturday afternoon?
That would work for me.
or morning
Let's do it Haws.
Bryan Samuelson
I'm available at 1. But there's also the Utah game at 1 I want to watch. But I'd be willing to
TiVo
Brayden Haws
I can whenever. I'm going to the fair that nght
I don't even care if I watch the game, that's how much I hate the U
Edward Ekstrom
Blasphemy Haws.
Brayden Haws
Merit was right
Edward Ekstrom
You better not literally mean that.
Brayden Haws
It ruins your fanhood
Bryan Samuelson
You don't mean that. This is all the bureaucrats fault
Bourgeoisie
Pershing
Ordain women
Utah fan man
Coach Kyle is sill true
Edward Ekstrom
Bsam, let's play at one and watch the tivo game right after.
Bryan Samuelson
I'd do that in a heartbeat
Brayden Haws
I'd do that too
Of course I'm gonna watch the game
But I still hate utah
Merit Egan
May I also say this regarding fanhood. I am and have been quite a diehard BYU fan as you all know. That said, BYU and Utah breaking up has damaged the fanhood greatly. It's like if they took the playoffs out of the NBA. A huge part of the season is just gone. It has damaged my amount of interest in BYU and college football all together.
It is sad, that is all.
Bryan Samuelson
I agree merit. I don't like it one bit
Brayden Haws
Brayden Haws liked Merit Egan's status update
Edward Ekstrom
Edward Ekstrom liked Merit Egan's status update
Merit Egan
BYU and Utah will never compete for the playoffs, or if they do it will be once every 46 years, so that game is a huge part of what both teams have to play for.
I think it will come back soon, right?
like I know we play on and off  right now, but they will make it permanent, right?
Edward Ekstrom
Pac 13
Add BYU
Bryan Samuelson
I believe so. I thinks it's two years off and supposed to be steady after that. We'll see. But hopefully the public backlash against us not playing will convince them to do the right thing in the future
Edward Ekstrom
My diploma got sent out yesterday.  Ayoooooooooooooooooooo
Merit Egan
Did it get free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime?
Edward Ekstrom
I think it is a good thing to go to your rival school because it makes you want to beat them in sports even more.
And kill some of their professors.
What kind of phone did Teezer get?
Merit Egan
I'm proud of Teezer's choice
Edward Ekstrom
What was it?
Brayden Haws
Teezr good phone choice
Edward Ekstrom
For the liberation
Love*

Nice rhyme. Doesn't make sense
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws

"Betrayal"
"Betrayal"

Edward Ekstrom

Jeff said he is likely
Merit Egan

John Sherwood
He who betrays is an ass, he who slays is class
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
Do we have enough halo 2 discs?
I love Halo 2
Brayden Haws
What did we play last time?
Edward Ekstrom
Halo 3
I prefer halo 3
We should have a vote though
Brayden Haws
I think the halo 2 levels are better. Like the ones on 3 they tried to make cooler but I think it made them worse
Edward Ekstrom
2 for halo 2; 1 for halo 3
John Sherwood
Neutral
Brayden Haws
I like 3 if we just play Zanzibar
Edward Ekstrom
Do you vote 3 or 2 heezler?
Brayden Haws
Lets do some of both
Win win win
zach fackrell
I'll play 3
Merit Egan
I like both as well, but I agree with haws, I only really like zanzibar on 3.
Edward Ekstrom
3 chant!  3 chant!  3 chant!  Salt Lake!
You're telling me you don't like that level with the covenant shotgun?
Merit Egan
I hate that one.
With the hammer?
Edward Ekstrom
Whaaaaaa?

Merit Egan
GAYYYYY
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Merit Egan
I wish I had that gif right now
Edward Ekstrom
I'm crying a little that you don't like that one.
No vehicles.  Now I get it.
At least we can all agree that halo 4 sucks.
Merit Egan
Ok it is ok. It is just a ways behind lockout
Edward Ekstrom
http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1yrlk2/rank_your_favorite_halo_multiplayer_best_to_worst/
A lot of people say reach is the best.
Brayden Haws
No way
Zanzi
Edward Ekstrom
Not level.
game
a lot of people say reach is the best game
Tyson Amundsen
I feel like looking that they are saying reach was the worst
Most say H3 then H2
Edward Ekstrom
No > means greater than
Tyson Amundsen
they always put reach at the end, meaning its the least. And I like both. If we do H2 we will have an advantage over reed and spenny
Not always but frequently it looked like
Edward Ekstrom
H3> Reach> H4> H2> H1
so you're saying they think 3 is the words?
worst*
Reach > H2 > H4 > H1 > H3
H3 > H2 > Reach > H1 > H4

NBA SHOWTIME> COD
Edward Ekstrom
We will have a vote tonight
See what it tastes like.
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah. That to me shows reach is not thought of as the best
And H3 is
Edward Ekstrom
I'm not saying it is, I was just surprised that some people put it at the top of their lists.
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah well, some people also think big government is a good idea
So we know those people are
They are also the ones who wear scrubs on campus
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
And hang their ski goggles from the rear view mirror almost year round

Edward Ekstrom
Was the kitchen okay last time r should we bring another tv an put it in the basement?
Remember when we used to have 4 tvs in the same room
Merit Egan
It is really fun to have multiple tvs in one room. #rivalry
Edward Ekstrom

Edward Ekstrom
Crazy dream. Everyone who was playing halo yesterday was with me trying to recover some pirates treasure. We were coming out I the water up onto the beach where it was buried and we found it under some flat rocks. There was some long stringy plant under the rocks too that turned into a snake. Then all of a sudden the snake was huge (like 3 times thicker than the snake in the movie anaconda) and we had to hold its mouth shut with our strength as Zach hacked it's head off with a saw.
Jeff Knudsen
a basalisk!  Hey, who wants to go to the greek festival today at 2?  Text me because I don't have chats on my phone.
Tyson Amundsen
Great dream ed
Edward Ekstrom
Thanks teez. It was truly great.
Tyson Amundsen
Can we make any kind of plans for the Utah game?
Brayden Haws
Great great dream
Sounds like a wet one
Tyson Amundsen

John Sherwood
Just let reed kill the snake
Merit Egan
Haha haws
Haha john
Good dream ed
Slinging zingers this morning
Tyson Amundsen
There used to be a saying 'speed kills'
Turns out the saying is actually 'reed kills'
Saturday, September 6, 2014 3:55 PM
Merit Egan
I imagine you are all watching the U game, but since that is not exciting, the USC vs. Stanford game is heating up.
Brayden Haws
Merit how date you
Merit Egan
I'm just saying, if you want to watch Utah's backups over a 10-10 game in the 4th... go for it.
Brayden Haws
Haha safe wisdom
Patriarch wisdom
John Sherwood
We are going to state fair tonight at 8. Leaving my house at 730 if ne1 wants to caravan. Stopping at smiths to get tix for 7$. Everyone is welcome
Brayden Haws
We also are going
zach fackrell
Kim and I are also going as well too
Brayden Haws
Ayoooooooo
They got chicken and waffles on a stick!!! The fair rocks
zach fackrell
Oh now I'm freakin pumped
John Sherwood
I'm getting a bunt cake
Tyson Amundsen
Someone get funnel cake in my honor.
Also haws, Doyle has been on a roll on twitter. Just referenced that Kreis should buy Yura Movsisyan at NYCFC
Brayden Haws
Haha I saw that
Doyle had a lot of good tweets today
Tyson Amundsen
Also here's my report of the Greek festival. Very little to do there except food, which was good not great. Had calamari for the first time. Also learned about the Greek orthodox church a little. Turns out they don't have their own pope
Brayden Haws
Sounds interesting, but not exciting?
Tyson Amundsen
Fascinating but not captivating
Merit Egan
Informative, but not interesting?
Colby Condie
I will also be at the fair tonight. In fact my wife and I are currently at the Sherwood's watching them cook dinner
Tyson Amundsen
Pics plz..?
Also tasty but not mouthwatering
Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
I believe
Merit Egan
You will be judged on taste, presentation, and creativity. #chopped
Brayden Haws
And as always on your use of today's mystery ingredients
Colby Condie
Mystery ingredient: horse penis
Merit Egan
For the appetizer, I'm going to prepare a slightly charred horse penis served over an arugula salad with a raspberry dressing.
zach fackrell

Merit Egan
What's after the fair? Anything?
Colby Condie

Fair update: sheep have massive tesricles
Tyson Amundsen
Now entering the game: Sebastian Jaime
Brayden Haws
God bless him
Merit Egan
Sabo is back and lookin good
Tyson Amundsen
We needed that win
Merit Egan
That was big
Tyson Amundsen
Sabo coming in and scoring was incredible!
I was hooting and hollering
Merit Egan
Sabo and Jaime will be fun out there
Tyson Amundsen
I agree. And Joao is a killer too. Life is good
Brayden Haws
Guys RSL is the best
We just always find he best players
Tyson Amundsen
Sure do
Merit Egan
If is were setting up a 3-4-1-2 like I do in fifa, I'd have Joao as the CF, Jaime and Sabo in front
If I*
Tyson Amundsen
Also not to ignore Colby- I for one knew nothing about sheep testicles
Surprising
But we have only female sheep cuz dudes don't give birth
There's some free knowledge for ya Jared
Merit Egan

I'd like to have Schuler out there. Gil too.
Tyson Amundsen
Good depth
Merit Egan
Does Vasquez still get time?
Jared Carter
Since I'm going to be a sheep mater for my career I thank you both for that valuable info. Large balls plus woman sheep = successfully career
Brayden Haws
Sabo is king

He just has missed the whole season
Tyson Amundsen

This is a great recipe for a fantasy loss. Projected to get 27 points and they combine for 2.8.

He makes me more mad than people not getting on the right team in halo
Edward Ekstrom
He makes me more mad than when everyone dicks around for ten minutes between halo matches.
Merit Egan
He makes me more mad than when everyone dicks around for ten minutes between halo matches.
He makes me more mad than when everyone dicks around for ten minutes between halo matches.
He makes me more mad than when everyone dicks around for ten minutes between halo matches.
Couldn't have said it better myself, Edward.
Edward Ekstrom
He makes me more mad than when everyone dicks around for ten minutes between halo matches.
Merit Egan
And when John tries to be on Reed's team and recreate the Dream Team vs. Zimbabwe
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
John Sherwood
He makes me more mad than always being in a ghost
Brayden Haws
Everyone pray for the broncos, they're being a bunch of poopbags right now
Merit Egan
They pulled through. Julius Thomas really pulled through for me in fantasy football.
Demaryius Thomas...not so much
Tyson Amundsen

Thoughts on that?
Brayden Haws
I think last year that was true
Not this year
Merit Egan
Peyton did better with that team
Brayden Haws
Andrew livingstons reply is spot on
And he's got Trevor Richardson who will be solid this year
Merit Egan
If Peyton had any defense with the colts, he'd have at least 2 super bowls.
That's how Eli got his
Tyson Amundsen
Who in this vox shares my deep love for oreos?
I always wanna talk about it but never know who to do it with
Brayden Haws
I like to open then and eat only one cookie and the cream and throw the dry side out
Unless it's double stuff then I keep both and dip em
Tyson Amundsen
I'm a puritan. I like original style. And I like to eat at least 8 at a time. More isn't bad either
Bryan Samuelson
I have a great love for Oreos. Hey are delicious
Brayden Haws
I like that you always have em in the cookie jar, I always try to have at least one while at your house
Brayden Haws changed the topic to Oreo Forum
Tyson Amundsen
I would choose oreos over any girl scout cookie
*throws down gauntlet*
Brayden Haws
I would pick a Samoa
El fudge is my favorite, which is why I like going to Johns parents, they always have em in stock
Monday, September 8, 2014 8:33 AM
Edward Ekstrom
I like Oreo ice cream but not plain Oreos.
Colby Condie
Oreos are way good. But even better with a tall glass of milk
Merit Egan
Milk is a necessity for me to truly enjoy oreos.
Bryan Samuelson
It's been said that Oreos are milk's favorite cookie
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Haha that's pretty awesome.
zach fackrell
I like chewy chips ahoy
And milanos
And double stuff
And thin mints
Merit Egan
If you like cookies, go to fabulous Freddy's at quarry bend and get their sugar cookie with the frosting. You'll never want an oreo again.
Brayden Haws
Zach the smiths brand of chewy chips ahoy are super great, better than the real ones is say
Edward Ekstrom
I hate cookies
I only like carrot cake.
zach fackrell
Homemade Oreos are suuup good too
Brayden Haws
What everyone doing tonight? Can we feef?
Edward Ekstrom
Carrot cake from "The Store" is the best dessert on the planet.
zach fackrell
Mmmmnnooo
*yes
Colby Condie
Reese's Oreos are way good too
Edward Ekstrom
Mrs. Havershum hasn't had a Reese's cup... in yeeeeaaaarrrrrsss.
Tyson Amundsen
Reese oreos?
Merit Egan
Oreo is really trying some new flavors. Birthday cake, reeses, caramel apple
Colby Condie
Yeah Tyson they're way good. Obviously nothing can compare with the original Oreo.. But the Reese's Oreo is a close second
Brayden Haws
I like the bday cake
And the cookie dough
Merit Egan
Oreo also has mega stuff, which is thicker than double stuff. I hear it is too much though. Never tried it myself.
Brayden Haws
They also have chips ahoy filled with Oreo creme
Edward Ekstrom
I would like to golf this week.  Who wants to join me?
We haven't done a friend golf for a long time.
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws

So I'll have to feef with merit instead
Merit Egan

Samuel McConkie

Brayden Haws
Merit I'll join you
Season tix are like 5 dollars
I actually think they pay you to go
Edward Ekstrom
Sweet
They won't change their fight song.
Brayden Haws
Or make us respect women
Edward Ekstrom
Sam and I are golfing at 1 if anyone want's to join us.
Merit Egan
Yeah, even the nfl is all like..."don't beat women." WTF
Edward Ekstrom
Merit, give golf one last shot with your friends Sam and Eddy

Edward Ekstrom
apple event is live on apple.com
zach fackrell
Watching it now
Edward Ekstrom
for any technology people out there.
The new ceo looks like a dork.
steve was a dork too I guess.
Zach, do you hear all of the stupid translators?
zach fackrell
What the heck is wrong with the broadcast???
Hahah yeah
Apple sucks
Edward Ekstrom
WTF
zach fackrell
What a joke
Edward Ekstrom
wow.
zach fackrell
It's lagging and shiz
Edward Ekstrom
Apple sucks.
I'm sticking with Android.
Merit Egan
Also, I'm trying to pull it up, but you have to have apples operating system to watch the video?
Edward Ekstrom
the camera sticks out on the iphone 6
gaaaaaaay
Yeah it has to be safari
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Another gay apple thing
Merit Egan
#upsidedownphoto
It seems like you would want it available across all platforms. Bigger reach ya know?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah, Apple's stupid and gay
Samuel McConkie
Does everyone's have an annoying Chinese translator in their apple stream?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Merit Egan
No I have nothing cause I don't have a mac.
All I have is twitter and people are ripping apple to shreds.
Edward Ekstrom
What are they saying?
zach fackrell
Yeah what they say?
Merit Egan
Just about the horrible stream and Chinese translator
Edward Ekstrom
Oh haha
Samuel McConkie
Yeah those are both awful
Edward Ekstrom
What do people think of the new look?
It's much rounder.
zach fackrell
My stream just cut out..
Brayden Haws
I'm sick of iPhone
Merit Egan
Not a lot about that yet. People seem to like it. Some people are criticizing the large screen. I would never criticize a large screen.
Samuel McConkie
Volume buttons went back to the first generation iphone
Brayden Haws
There was this Chinese kid who had an iPhone 6 who was posting videos of him using it online and wasn't liking it
Merit has long preached the galaxy and he is true
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
Still a crappy battery.
They were bragging that it has equal or better battery than the 5.
I would sure hope so since the 5 battery sucks aaaaaa
just have to plug it in all day.
zach fackrell
Haha literally
Merit Egan
Everyone just get the note 4 that just came out. It's so cool.
Edward Ekstrom
I'm waiting for them to talk about the payment system.
If that is cool, I will consider an iPhone.
So far not convinced.
Merit Egan
will they use NFC?
Brayden Haws
The video I saw the kid said it basically had a built in credit card strip
Edward Ekstrom
Well I think they put NFC but that is old news for android
what I care about is the iBeacon low-power wifi payment.
zach fackrell
Camera looks legit
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah that's nothing new either.
I have always thought iPhone pictures were better.
zach fackrell
But it's even better with the 6. So that's kewl
Merit Egan
But I think that also had to do with screen size. A 13 megapixel picture will look better on a small screen
Brayden Haws
Yeah I think merits pics always look way better than mine
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah that's an opinion thing
Merit Egan
I think cameras are a wash at thus point
Edward Ekstrom
I have always just thought iPhone color was better
Merit Egan
Everyone will have a good camera.
I hope iPhone gets the ability to beam pictures, and that it can cross to android.
Edward Ekstrom
I just want all keys and payment systems to work through my phone.
And then I will buy that phone.
broadcast pooped out again.
zach fackrell
It's been in and out for me way too much
Samuel McConkie
Mine won't even let me on their website anymore
zach fackrell
Ya that happened to me too
But I'm back
There's no 32 gig..
It goes from 16 to 64 to 132 gig
Samuel McConkie
Is their a $200 price gap between 16gb and 64gb?
zach fackrell


Samuel McConkie
That's cool. Cheaper than before
zach fackrell
Payment plans eddy..
Brayden Haws
What's different from regular and plus?
Merit Egan
The plus has a bigger screen
Which I'm all for.
zach fackrell
Longer battery life and stuff
Eddy you watching?
Apple pay
Merit Egan
Nobody will ever regret a bigger screen. That is a promise.
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah I'm watching
but it's still just like android
zach fackrell
Cool cool
It's nice that Apple is catching on
Edward Ekstrom
nfc is what android has always had
zach fackrell
I just want $1 chipotle
Edward Ekstrom
I want long rang payment

Colby Condie
the apple stream just cut out for me. and now it just blew up my laptop into shreds
merit do you find your phone to be too big to fit in your pocket?
Merit Egan
Haha
No it fits great.
Brayden Haws
I'm really wanting to get the s5 active
Merit Egan
The big iPhone is 5.5 inches and the note is 5.7. Apple users will be very happy with the big screen.
Haws, get the note 4 or the s5. They are sweet.
Brayden Haws
Yeah I want the s5
I like that it's water proof and drop proof. Cause I use my phone to workout and it gets all nasty
Or if I take it hiking
Alex Platis
Haws you can't fit a phone that big into your skinny jeans
Your small wang barely fits as it is
Brayden Haws
Al why do you hate me?
Is this about the dog?
Alex Platis
It's about you being a hipster
Just grow a mustache and move to Brooklyn already
Brayden Haws
Guys am I a hipster? I hate myself
Merit Egan
The s5 is waterproof
Alex Platis
Skinniest jeans around? Check. Love for Bright Eyes? Check.
Brayden Haws
Does getting a galaxy make me more or less hipster?
Alex Platis
Just need to start drinking PBR and you'll be the hipster king
Merit Egan
Way less hipster haws
Alex Platis
I'd say less. Hipsters have flip phones or iPhones
Brayden Haws
Well I gotta get that phone then
Alex Platis
And some pants that can hold it
Go to Mr. Mac and buy some pleated trousers.
Brayden Haws
Al I'm gonna go kill myself and it will be your fault
Colby Condie
mr mac trousers are the worst
parachute pants
Alex Platis
Haws don't kill yourself. That would make you even more hipster.
Like Elliott Smith
zach fackrell
Haws don't kill yourself
Colby Condie
haws i love you
zach fackrell
Ever
You're The Hague man
Alex Platis
You just need to take angry old man lessons from Tyson. And listen to more Toby Keith.
Brayden Haws

Sam and I just Braved the rainiest game of golf ever completed
Wussy men were leaving the course left and right as we trudged on
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
We were getting rained on.
We were getting muddy.
We were getting struck by lightning.
We were getting stabbed.
We were getting shanked.
We were getting shot at.
Colby Condie
You were getting tridents thrown at you
Edward Ekstrom
We were getting accused.
We were getting abused.
Colby Condie
Your pets heads were falling off
Brayden Haws
eddy wish i was there to fight the storm with you
Edward Ekstrom
Me too.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha what a great day in the vox. In summary: I'm glad i have a galaxy

He hasn't been on that much... in years
Merit how do I do italicized text on my phone?

Mario Kart at the condies?
Haws mansion party?
Brayden Haws
Sadly hipster haws has to work
So I can buy more hipster thing a
Things
Colby Condie
Oohh a movie in eds basement followed by body body sounds nice
Edward Ekstrom
I don't think we could play body body body at my dad's
Possibly a movie in the theatre.  I would have to ax my Dad.
Colby Condie
Eddy don't ax your dad. That would get bloody. Just ask him
Edward Ekstrom
Good call.
I'll do that.
Merit Egan
Let's find out our options
Who's down to partay?
John Sherwood
Possibly.. drillbit taylor is my vote fir a movie
Colby Condie
Or heavyweights
Bryan Samuelson
Guys I want to party, but I am a slave to my estudies
Merit Egan
Yes to both movies. I have the new Godzilla movie, has anyone seen it? Is it good?
Edward Ekstrom
I haven't seen it yet.
Brayden Haws
Heavyweights is the best
Also if anyone cares the new U2 album is free on iTunes
Colby Condie
Yup haws heavyweights is the best. And I downloaded that album today. It's good
John Sherwood
General conference speakers can speak in their native language now.
Edward Ekstrom
Really?
Colby Condie
Yeah I saw that too. Pretty cool
Merit Egan
I know where they can find a great Chinese translator. #AppleLive
Edward Ekstrom
Haag
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah that's rad
John Sherwood
So friend night or no? We cant be out super late so I'd prefer starting a movie at 8 or 830 eh?
Merit Egan
Agreed!
Tyson Amundsen
I work til 11. I would love a good ol fashioned movie at ed 's soon
Free u2? Yes please
Bryan screw your period
Edward Ekstrom
Let's play games instead of movie
More friend interaction
Want to come over to our crib?
We just got monopoly deal
Sam, you and codi come?
Samuel McConkie
We are at an institute class until 9. Will you still be playing then?
Edward Ekstrom

Samuel McConkie

Edward Ekstrom
Merit John?
Are you guys backing out?
Merit Egan
Just got home from dinner. Let me see what we doin up on here. Is this high stakes?
Edward Ekstrom
Yes
Merit Egan
What I need right now is for everyone to blow on your phone screen. Do it!

Edward Ekstrom
I laughed at that. But I'm not laughing at how long you all are taking to respond. We are going to Annie's sisters to chill, out for game night.
Merit Egan

This is what eddy was like after the cow gif.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha merit I love the notebook one
Also let's talk sports. MLS is changing their logo. This is a good article about whether or not it's a good move http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2027513/major-league-soccer-shouldnt-ditch-its-classic-logo
I don't see why it's necessary. I think teams change colors and logos too much as it is
Even the jazz

#shoemantweets
Edward Ekstrom
Merit that was great
Perfectly described what I did.
Brayden Haws
I hate shoeman
Colby Condie
Just finished Italian guys
Tyson Amundsen
Colb what do you think about the logo
Colby Condie
I think it's unnecessary to be honest. Like the reasons teams change their logo is pure marketing reasons. Fans will buy new jerseys because they don't want to be seen wearing the old one. But think about other sports.. NBA MLB NFL. I feel like they haven't changed their logo in decades and there's been very few changes ever.
Edward Ekstrom
I quote Colby. "I think it's unnecessary to be honest."
Commas save your integrity Colby.
Tyson Amundsen
Great points all
Merit Egan
What's an integrity Colby?
Colby Condie
I believe integrity is an old wooden ship used in the Civil War era
Tyson Amundsen
Merit for the win!
Edward Ekstrom
Haha colby for the win
That was good though, Merit.
Merit Egan
Grammar is tough in hangouts. We should try to be mistake free all day long tomorrow.
Edward Ekstrom
Alright, let's do it!
Merit Egan
Good luck to all of my friends.
Colby Condie
Haha merit yes I must acknowledge yours was funny
Mistake free Wednesday. Perfect grammar and spelling all day long
Merit Egan
I'm scared. I don't want to mess it up.
Bryan Samuelson
Colby, Eddy, and Merit: I applaud you. I chuckled.
Edward Ekstrom
I don"t want, to mess' it up Ether;
Colby Condie
Haha
Wednesday, September 10, 2014 6:45 AM
John Sherwood
I'll kick off Mistake Free Wednesday. Good morning 'X'cerpt. May our days be filled with wonder and joy.
Did I make a mistake already?
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know, John. It looked alright to me!
Brayden Haws

Amy tweeted this, can someone with Instagram investigate this, there's probably a ton more funny/weird ones like this
Tyson Amundsen
Which Amy?
I believe there are grammatical errors in Brayden's vox.
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, you have ruined our game.
Brayden Haws
Buehler
I don't have time for games when merit doesn't wanna talk about carls jr. This is serious
I'm messing up on purpose
Merit Egan
Haws, I'm going to do this to you if you don't start behaving. Do you understand?
Brayden Haws
Understood.
Forgive me, for I have sinned.
Brayden Haws changed the topic to Merit's Magical Gif Land of Gifs

Bryan Samuelson
Don't tell Schumann
Edward Ekstrom
You're going to enter cardiac arrest.
Bryan, you forgot to put a period at the end of your sentence.
Zach, your sentence should have been
"Guys, good morning."
not
" Guys good morning ."
zach fackrell
Eddy,

My sentence "should have read" not "should have been"
Edward Ekstrom
Good, Zach.
Zach, you forgot the period at the end of your last sentence.
Although, I think "should have been" also works.

Edward Ekstrom
Nope, not at all.
Who wants to play a sport tonight?
Tennis, Basketball, scatterball.
Edward Ekstrom
Hello?
Teezer, I know you saw it.
Merit has a family basketball game tonight so he has an excuse for not responding.  Tyson, you have no such excuse.
Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
Alrighty then.
Brayden Haws
Eddy I'd love to play basketball
Edward Ekstrom
Me too
Who else would love to play?

In other words, if you cut it out of a pieces of cardboard could not fit through it's own hole.
Merit Egan
Growing triangles
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
One correct answer would be a circle.
Another would be a rouleaux triangle.
Another would be a rouleaux pentagon.
another would be a rouleaux septagon
Another would be a Hendecagon
A rouleaux Hendecagon, that is.
Edward Ekstrom
Tennis anyone?

Brayden Haws
Guys we're all awake, what a sick world we live in
Colby Condie
Exactly haws. Anything before 8 should be banned. But I unfortunately have fiscals to attend to and wake up at the butt crack of dawn on Tuesday and Thursday
Thursday, September 11, 2014 12:54 PM
Merit Egan changed the topic to Fiscally Responsible Fiscalizers
Merit Egan
3 people awake before 7. Scary. And of course zach was awake. Or in a deep coma by now.
Colby Condie
haha. I bet I got up the earliest today. can anyone beat 5:37?
Brayden Haws
Colby that is so sick
I feel sorry for you
Colby Condie
i also feel sorry for me
Edward Ekstrom
Colby, that is unnatural.
You're just a Chinese rice farmer.
Brayden Haws
I'd rather go to bed at 5:37 and only be able to sleep for 3 hours than to be able to sleep for 10 hours and have to wake up at 5:37
Merit Egan
Meanwhile, Mario is not fiscally responsible.
Colby Condie
haha

saw that today too ed. funny
Tyson Amundsen
I did hear that Colb. On the whole I don't like it, I would have preferred it to be in local control
Crawdad pointed out that it was relatively inexpensive for Vail to buy it
The bonus is you can get passes to all the places they own for a discount rate
Think pass of all passes but skiing
Colby Condie
Epic pass right?
Tyson Amundsen
For Vail resorts yes
Most resorts have some kind of collaboration like that now
They need it to be competitive
Snow bird and deer valley and Alta do the Wasatch benefit
Brighton and solitude do the big cottonwood pass
Those are just the local deals too
Colby Condie
how much does the UFS sell passes for?
Tyson Amundsen
Depends on each resort
Snowbird is 529 or 480
Canyons 499 or 399
Alta 550
Brighton 450 or 200
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0
Yeah baby! !!
Watch that again guys, we've forgotten how funny it is
Brayden Haws
i like when that guy in the car starts rapping
Colby Condie
Guys is this northern lights things for real? I just told a customer at the bank about it. Hope I didn't look like an idiot
Brayden Haws
colb its real, i feel like there's no guarantee that we'll see it but the circumstances of tonight give us a great chance to see it
make your own luck
Colb, baseball topic. Chris Davis just got suspended for amphetamine use; do you think we've reached a point where we have to assume everyone is using PED's and sports commentators and outlets need to stop praising players for doing things the right way and playing so well clean? Cause they get all this praise heaped on them and then it always seems to turn out to be a lie
#sad
Colby Condie
It really is sad. I would agree that most players probably use PEDs to some extend at some point in their career. I think it's stupid that we haven't implemented a mandatory drug test for anyone that steps foot on the field. That would do one of two things: 1)weed out all the drug users or 2) make people stop taking them.
The steroids era has been going on long enough.
Merit Egan
Stephen Colbert made a good point. Now that we've seen people perform at this level, how can we possibly go back. PED's for everyone!
The consumer will suffer from these guys going off PED'S.
Brayden Haws
Its true I think, the public says they want a clean sport but also people love the long ball so they expect players to hit which PED's provide
Ultimately money runs sports so I dont think we"ll see reform
Merit Egan
Sports are idiots. Always.
Also, can I say that I think it is ridiculous that people are calling for Goodell to step down because of this Ray Rice issue.
Edward Ekstrom
That's the first time I have ever seen that Friday video. WTF was that?
Merit Egan
Haha really? Just some girl who tried to get famous and make a cool song, but she only got famous cause it was sooooo bad.
And it is sooooo bad. Tyson, good job.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha how is that your first time ed? It went viral a few years ago. It was sad and funny at the same time. Millions of people were talking about how bad it was and how much they all hated Rebecca black haha
Erstwhile I invite all me everywhere to watch the RSL game at my house at 830 before we trek up big cottonwood to hunt the northern lights
all men
But so all me
Cuz I'm gonna be there
Brayden Haws
everyone hated her
even the pope hated her
Merit Egan
Guys, she just wanted to kick it in the front seat, sit in the back seat. We don't need to hate her. But we do.
Edward Ekstrom
I don't hate her, I actually think it was good. Other than her voice and the lyrics..
It is catchy though, got to give her that.
Merit Egan
Everybody does love Fridat
Edward Ekstrom
I'm going to have "partyin partyin, YEAH!" stuck in my head all dang day.
Merit Egan
Gosh dang it. Friday.
Edward Ekstrom
I'm mad I can't go tonight. I'm still sick as a dog.
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws

Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha yes
He tweeted about how much he sounds like a tool. Yet he embraces it

Brayden Haws
Sam if you havent figured out yet, we know that kid and hate everything he says
Merit Egan
We need another twitter war. We'll pounce when the right tweet comes out.
Tyson Amundsen
My tongue and sword are sharp and ready
Merit Egan
Lead us into battle General Amundsen
Tyson Amundsen

Let's warm up with this. How do these things correlate at all?
Teenage girls probably have no idea when the state loses jobs
Brayden Haws
wtf?
yeah im sure they have no idea
Merit Egan
I don't know, but the team Chronic played last night will be at risk of suicide if any of them lose their jobs.
Brayden Haws
my guess is lack of jobs leads to bad home lifes and then they commit suicide
Merit Egan
#CauseTheyWereBlack
Edward Ekstrom
Their parents can't buy them clothes and makeup so they commit suicide.
Edward Ekstrom
Or maybe the girls commit suicide which causes depression in the home and then the dad looses his job.
And the high girls suicide rate is caused by something completely different. Like say, social media.
Merit Egan
And all the social media issues arise from poor front facing cameras which cause bad selfies.
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Brayden Haws
Merit you've converted me. I'm getting a galaxy next month
Merit Egan


What are you gonna get?
Brayden Haws
Haha the Asian
S5
My mom just got it but now switched to att so she is getting the new note when that comes out and giving me the s5
Merit Egan
Oh baby baby

Tyson Amundsen

I can be about anywhere by 4:10-4:14
Even earlier probably, shai works after me so she usually gets here pretty early
Tyson Amundsen
I have keys to my church but it is small
Brayden Haws
I can also ask Collin and his friends
Tyson Amundsen
Porter has committed
Bryan Samuelson
Scott, John?
Edward Ekstrom
What time were the lights visible last night?
Brayden Haws
Like midnight, sky lit up like a fireworks show
Edward Ekstrom
We're going tonight.
Samuel McConkie
Where did you go to see them?
Edward Ekstrom
It said it will be good like 50 minutes before moonrise.
Yeah, where do we go?
Brayden Haws
Just kidding we went to guardsmans but we couldn't see anything
Edward Ekstrom
Oh really?
I think you gusy went too late
Brayden Haws
People in Idaho could see it perfect apparently
But no one in utah saw it from what we could tell
Edward Ekstrom
The director of clark planetarium said 10pm is optimal
after sunset and before moonrise.
If you don’t get to see it Friday night, Saturday night could be another opportunity.
“Tomorrow, Saturday, could be another good one. The moon will rise about 50 minutes later and we could still be in the middle of this solar storm,” Jarvis said.
Brayden Haws
Yeah Stevie tried that yesterday but I don't think he saw anything
Edward Ekstrom
Oh lame.
Brayden Haws
I just don't think it's coming down far enough. Like people in Seattle and Idaho were posting crazy pictures of it
But it looked just like a normal sky here
The last thing I saw yesterday was saying you may see a red glow but that's it
Edward Ekstrom
Lame
Brayden Haws
We need to road trip to Idaho tonight
Like to the tip
Edward Ekstrom
The northern tip?
Canada boarder?
Brayden Haws
Yeah

This is from Seattle last night
Edward Ekstrom
Whaaaaaa
Brayden Haws

Canadian border
John Sherwood
Shii
That's crazy
Tyson Amundsen
"Just the tip" -Bryan
Colby Condie
Guys Georgia kicks off at 1:30 today. I get off at 3 (hopefully earlier cause I'm at a slow branch today). I'm recording the Georgia game and really really want to watch that
#conflict
Edward Ekstrom
Watch it after bball
Tyson Amundsen
I hate races and half marathons
Brayden Haws
Agreed. Always blocking up the roads
Tyson Amundsen
They close all the roads
Fort union is a DISASTER
Screw all this
Run on the gosh dang sidewalks
Or on a treadmill
Brayden Haws
What's the realistic chances we play basketball? I hope high
Bryan Samuelson
I'm in to play. First let's establish a location, then we'll do roll call
Tyson's church?
Brayden Haws
Tyson's church is pretty small
But we could still go there
Bryan Samuelson
Indeed. Do we have other options?
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan your job is to get the location
Brayden Haws
We just gotta break in somewhere
It's Saturday I bet the stake center is open
Does colbs fam still have keys to that good church?
Bryan Samuelson
Colb seemed uncertain about keys last time I talked to him
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan make it happen. Willow creek stake center
Brayden Haws
Just go break in Bryan
John Sherwood
Sam the ball kicker. Get him
And reed and spenny. Say we're playing halo
Bryan Samuelson
Sam has been texted, as have other peeps. No luck yet
Haha good john
Sam is out of town. Cuss
Brayden Haws
If we can't do it then I vote we play halo
Tyson Amundsen
Gay. This is what I hate about playing bball. It should not be this hard to get a location
Bryan text your bishop for access to the stake center
The YSA one
By flat iron
zach fackrell
Let's just play tennis instead
Bryan Samuelson
I'm going to check a couple churches right now to see if we get lucky. If that doesn't work I would play at Teezers church
Merit Egan
#poolSelfie
Bryan Samuelson
No luck. Who would play at Tyson's? Who would play tennis? I would do either at this point
Tyson Amundsen
No believe bball is broken.
I would tennis
Could tennis
Can we swim zeez
Edward Ekstrom

Bryan Samuelson
Parcheesi, that's it. I'd love that
Merit Egan
I figured something had to have happened to Joe. He looks like a completely different person. Is he ok now?
Colby Condie
Lauren and I are at the US womens game. It's halftime. We are down for potential partying if something is happening
Bryan Samuelson
Ok I'm going to play tennis with Jeff and Tyson now
Brayden Haws

Happy Sunday
Merit Egan
Haha. Worst sport ever.
Tyson Amundsen
What the heck was that
Brayden Haws
Combat juggling
The name says it all
Merit Egan
The defense should have to be juggling always too. They would just run around hold sticks and hitting people.
Brayden Haws
The coolest part was when the one kid got whacked and just threw all his sticks and you're thinking he's an idiot and then the camera pans and his teammate caught them all
Tyson Amundsen
I'll be honest I have no clue what was going on most of the time . It was way more confusing than roller derby
Merit Egan
What are the positions in roller derby
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan? Kenzo staples is dead to you
Dude merit you got the jammer
And a few blockers
Merit Egan
If walking dead happened, my first order of business would be to seek out Schumann and stab him in the head. Whether he was a zombie or not.
Brayden Haws
Haha agreed merit
Even if walking dead didn't happen that would be my first order of business
Merit Egan
Haha, let's get on it
Merit Egan
Found Colby at the San Diego Zoo.
Colby Condie
Hahaha. #condor

Check out @WillParchman's Tweet: https://twitter.com/WillParchman/status/511375726826647552
Haws and all sports lovers- this is a good article. It talks about how statistically MLS fouls it's creative players way more than other top leagues
Bryan Samuelson
I thought we were screen shotting now Tyson
Tyson Amundsen
Javier morales at the top of the list
Screen shots won't link to articles tho
Bryan Samuelson
Oh gotcha. I was thinking Schumann tweets, apologies
Tyson Amundsen
Ronaldo, Di Maria, and even robben are fouled less than once a game
Interesting to think about someone like robben, who has a reputation for diving. Yet he doesn't get fouled much
Monday, September 15, 2014 8:22 AM
Brayden Haws
Tyson read the article and liked it
In terms of Javi especially, I feel like defenders are always just destroying him, I'm surprised he's not injured more
Also the purple haired Spanish hipster line was hilar
Tyson Amundsen
Haha right? Really surprising facts about how infrequently many top players in Europe are fouled
Monday, September 15, 2014 12:34 PM

http://www.rslsoapbox.com/2014/9/15/6153815/why-we-should-all-be-supporting-seattle-sounders-in-the-usoc-final
Seattle is likely to win the supporters shield with the best record in the league. We realistically can place second behind them if we beat out the galaxy. If we earn more points than DC United and are second overall and Seattle wins the Open Cup, RSL inherits a champions League spot

Also nothing can be more useless than this
Brayden Haws
No way that's real
Edward Ekstrom
Bball?
Brayden Haws
I would
Merit Egan

So, in fact, it was a superb delivery.
Unlike you heretofore supposed.
Brayden Haws
Oh I thought auto correct just kept messing up your joke
Edward Ekstrom
Nope.
That was for those who didn't get it at first.
Brayden Haws
Haha well it was funny
Edward Ekstrom

Tyson Amundsen

Bryan Samuelson

Edward Ekstrom
So no one can tennis?
Tyson Amundsen

John Sherwood
Are we trying to go to the ReAl game Friday??
Tyson Amundsen
John I want to
Eddy it's my mom's b day also so I'm going home now to party
John, I called the ticket office and it's all sold out but the maverick corner. Need to go to maverick and by valtures and then take them to the stadium to get them redeemed
And if that's the plan I would propose doing them sooner rather than later because we may not be able to assure we get tickets next week other unless we do it early.
Set and Jared both have date on Friday and they would come down if we get the tickets. I would also get tickets and go on a date. So that would make at least six of us plus whoever else in the vox declares they would come
John Sherwood
I would come. Ju two. Making too
Tyson Amundsen
Ok I will look into it
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Fug

John Sherwood
Trick answer. 9. (I was tricked)
John Sherwood
Sman ed? What do you say?
Bryan Samuelson
I'm currently watching at my house while taking a math quiz. When I finish my quiz I'm ready to group watch
John Sherwood
Let me help you with math.
Bryan Samuelson
Ha well then come on over
Edward Ekstrom
I don't think I'll make it boys. Also, postponing halo until merit and Colby are back
Brayden Haws
I can attest John is great at math
Sometimes he came to my stats class for fun
John Sherwood
That's right. I'm coming over at half sman

Trav got destroyed
Tried to hurdle a guy, got flipped in the air and landed on his head
Bent his neck all weird
We're not looking good, but I wouldn't say we look bad
But clay had a big time punt return for a td
Tyson Amundsen
Holy shiz, 3 yards rushing?
Sounds like the defense was good tho
Way to go Bubba
Brayden Haws
Bubba's played well. Booker not so much

Tyson Amundsen
Just had dinner for Jan's b day. One of the servers came and said he recognized me. Turns out he graduated high school with us. Sam Whitkey
Or that's what it sounded like
Does anyone remember him?
Brayden Haws
Dood all I know is you talked him in weights and people loved you
Tyson Amundsen
I talked to him?
Brayden Haws
Tackled
John Sherwood
I love sam
Tyson Amundsen
I don't remember that. Haws I never had weights with you
Anyways I didn't have much comprehension but I luckily didn't say what I was thinking, which was that he's lost weight
Brayden Haws
I just remember you telling me that
Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooooooooooooo!
Bryan Samuelson
?
Edward Ekstrom
?
Money bags, Bryan!
Nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative.
Get's the people goin!
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good
Edward Ekstrom

Saw this today.
Colby Condie
Is that a moose? Those things are massive
Sunday, September 21, 2014 8:13 AM
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
Tyson Amundsen

Drew Fuller, mormon superstar
Page 19 of the ensign
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Brayden Haws
I feel like I've seen that picture like 3 times, he's a reoccurring star
Tyson Amundsen
Haha I know right?
Brayden Haws
Drews a real talent, but he hides his talents under a bushel all the time and stays home
Tyson Amundsen
Also funny is that this article is about attending institute. Which drew hasn't done for years
Brayden Haws
haha that's great
Colby Condie
Hahaha

Brayden Haws
Eddy you should remake juicy campus, you'd be a millionaire
http://fox4kc.com/2014/09/22/reporter-drops-f-bomb-on-live-television-quits-her-job/
This swears but also is funny
Bryan Samuelson
Hahaha Alaska we love you
Brayden Haws

Cam newton wearing leggings
Edward Ekstrom
Holy woof.
What is this world coming to?
Merit Egan
I'm dropping him from my fantasy team right now
Merit Egan
Does anyone want to party tonight? Not that we could successfully plan anything through this chat.
Brayden Haws
You know I will merit, if you get a better attitude about this chart
Chat
Tyson Amundsen
Merit man you're the patriarch. Act like it
Merit Egan
I thought we beat the disease long ago, but we didn't, and it's back.
Edward Ekstrom
It's like polio.
Guys, how can AT&T change my plan and start throttling me?
Merit Egan
What have they done?
Edward Ekstrom
Sucked a big As*
Tyson Amundsen
Quesadillas at the tute this week from 11-1 starting tomo. God is good
Edward Ekstrom

Father Merit. Forgive me, I have sinned.
Brayden Haws
Eddy I hate ATT I had unlimited data for so long and then when I upgraded they told me I had to restructure my plan
So faggy
Edward Ekstrom
What?
That is even worse.
How can they do that?
Tyson Amundsen
All companies do that. I also had unlimited data til I upgraded. They didn't know what they had when they started selling unlimited
Edward Ekstrom
My contract is old enough that they can't get out of continuing to give unlimited.
but they throttle.
Brayden Haws
Yeah they had no idea people would be doing Netflix and shiz
Edward Ekstrom
Because I'm sure they would have stopped my unlimited if they could.
And they write into the contract that we can't enter into a class action lawsuit against them.
Which is the gayest thing I have ever heard.
Brayden Haws
They control our phones and our lives
Edward Ekstrom
F AT&T.
Let's start a twitter trend.
Talking about how gay AT&T is.
And just talk about all of our complaints.
Brayden Haws
I'll just tweet them portraits of themselves
Aka pics of ugly weiners
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Ed they must have a way of getting you out of it. I couldn't upgrade my phone without losing it. How have you kept it? No new contract works with it. Like how do you get a new phone
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know, they have just never downgraded us and the only logical explanation is that ours is so old that they didn't write an out for themselves in the contract.
we got unlimited data when the first iPhone game out.
that was like 10 years ago.
Tyson Amundsen
Have you signed a new two year since then?
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah
every time we upgrade.

Merit Egan
Is the star changing it?
Tyson Amundsen
Interesting.
Merit Egan
With tmobs you get unlimited, but only like 3 GB is the 4GLTE
Edward Ekstrom
Gaaaaiiiyyyy
Brayden Haws
With mine only I had unlimited data cause I got it before the rest of my Fam and when they joined they had stopped doing unlimited. But then they said my upgrade was attached to the family plan so pretty much I could only get my new phone if I confirmed my data to the family plan
Edward Ekstrom
Gaaaaiiiyyyyy
Brayden Haws
Merit what are we gonna do tonight?
Edward Ekstrom
Just asked AT&T
here is what she said.
"  It depends on what upgrade they did. Also, they might have opted to change their plan to a different one or did not select the option to Add the upgrade to their existing plan. I am unable to disclose further information about what happened with their accounts for security reasons.   "
That's why you guys were kicked off unlimited and I was not.
Makes no sense to me.
Brayden Haws
No sense. Like pretty much that is what happened but they didn't really give us another choice
Edward Ekstrom
Gaaaiiiiiiyyyyy
I say we start our own cell phone company.
Everyone hates AT&T, Verizon, and everyone else.
We will just give everyone unlimited data.
and never throttle them.
and they will stay with use forever and always.
Brayden Haws

Top players in America
Can Gil really be that high TEEZR?
Tyson Amundsen
I feel I saw something about this tweet but it wouldn't load
Who made the list?
Brayden Haws
American Soccer Now was the account that tweeted it
Tyson Amundsen
Oh yeah. Well you would think it would mirror the world cup roster a little better.
Gil should be slightly lower but top 30 sounds right
How they don't have Landon Donovan I don't know
Since the world cup he had been fantastic
Is 19 Terrence Boyd? I can't see
Brayden Haws
I'm not sure
I couldn't get the actual name article to load
Tyson Amundsen
Lee Nguyen at 29 should be much higher. I world swap him for mix diskerud at 20 easy. And I would add Benny feilhaber from skc
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Why not play tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
Guys it's the roller derby on Friday. I wanna do it
Of course I do
Edward Ekstrom
That would be unprecedented, Haws.
Brayden Haws
I mean merit wants to hangout, I wanam hangout
So we might as well feef
Wives can have wives club
WHPFE
Edward Ekstrom
I might have to write some code tonight.
Brayden Haws
Wives of halo players home evening
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
If we can get at least 10, I promise to be there.
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think it's a halo night for me
I need a long time to dedicate for halo
Merit Egan
I would, but this chat won't accomplish it.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Merit, why do you hate the Google vox all of a sudden?
Tyson Amundsen
Yeah what the heck man
We rock
Edward Ekstrom
Remember the hard work and dedication it took to migrate everyone to the hangout merit.
Brayden Haws
Cool merit just hates us
Tyson Amundsen
Suck it merit
Brayden Haws
I'm deleting google hangouts
Tyson I'll see you in the vox
The true vox
Merit Egan
It is in a slump. I believe we can beat this, but we need to work hard to get us all together. There needs to be some sacrifice.
Perhaps we need to burn some staches
Brayden Haws
I think the real problem is that colby keeps leaving to st g and doesn't check the chart
Chat
Edward Ekstrom
I feel like everyone is just sharting up a big shart-hole in here.
Stop accusing, and love one another.
Brayden Haws changed the topic to The 'X' is Dead
Merit Egan
And then Jared pops up
Tyson Amundsen
Why are we in a slump? We're looking for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist
It works
Jared Carter
Guys we need to all get snap chat. So we can see each others faces Thtas the problem.
Brayden Haws
Coming to mock our hardships while he's at utah state getting with tons of hipster chicks
Tyson Amundsen
Just two weeks ago we planned an RSL party at my house no problem
The vox works
Brayden Haws
And I agree with this , everything was great and then suddenly merit was mad at it
Jared Carter
And send naked pics to each other.
Brayden Haws
But I'm not mad at merit
Tyson Amundsen
Pull your heads out of your butts
Brayden Haws
No one is, we love him
Tyson Amundsen
Me neither
Yeah
The harder anything pulls us apart the harder I pull back
Brayden Haws
I swore I wouldn't lose my head but then pop goes my heart
And I just can't let you go merit
Merit Egan
Haha ok guys thanks
The vox failed my attempts to get a basketball team together last week. I blame the vox for that forfeit.
Brayden Haws
Merit man but we were all willing to play but the time wasn't allowable
Isn't it the thought that counts?
Merit Egan
I just hope time allows for halo on the 4th. That will cure all.
I'm also just mad to be back at work after a vacation.
It's like I'm on my period or something
Merit Egan changed the topic to The 'X' Is Alive
Brayden Haws
Merit that was a test
And you passed
Tyson Amundsen
Haha the patriarchal period
What day is the fourth?
Merit Egan
Saturday
Which means we need a 3 hour warm up on Friday
Tyson Amundsen
The beta version
John Sherwood
Ha I'll be in st George that weekend
Colby Condie
Just got back from Cali/Vegas/StG/Beaver. I will have you know that I listened to every second of the true vox (that's like 50 voxes) and I caught up reading all the google voxes. I'm a true friend and you are my friends. Long live both voxes
Brayden Haws
Colb we knew you were true
Colby Condie
Teez the World Cup got stripped from Qatar? Probably a good choice
Tyson Amundsen
It's not official colb
A member of the executive committee said it was likely. But he is apparently a maverick that doesn't have much sway. So it appears it is still set to go
No one wants it there. Fifa is way corrupt
Tyson Amundsen

Tuesday, September 23, 2014 8:25 AM

John Sherwood

Bsams was the best.
Bryan Samuelson

Thank you ed

John Sherwood
Ooh kill em tzr
Edward Ekstrom
Confession. I love the fingerprint reader on my iPhone.
Brayden Haws
Did you get an iPhone for work Ed?
Edward Ekstrom
No it's my personal phone.
Brayden Haws
Why did you change back?
Edward Ekstrom
Not having to swipe is surprisingly nice.
Because I learned how to jailbreak safely.
And iPhone has NFC finally
Those were my reasons to switch to android.
Colby Condie
eddy did you get the 6 or 6+
Edward Ekstrom
6
Bryan Samuelson
Not having to swipe? Like when texting?
Edward Ekstrom
No, when opening your phone.
Brayden Haws
Like to unlock your phone
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
And since I have a developer account now I can install whatever the shiz I want without jailbreaking.
Bryan Samuelson
Oh gotcha

Adonal Foyle!
Helping the community by empowering poor children to play halo
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Who wants to give a brief history of how that part of the Xbox Controller Cord was name Adonal Foyle?
I don't remember.
Bryan Samuelson
It's all legend now. No one can distinguish truth from fable
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Haha this is such an important conversation
I love this
Edward Ekstrom
Agreed.
#adonalsBirth
Brayden Haws
Guys can I just say I hate Justin Spangler
I mean he's a nice enough guy but now that he's president I just hate everything about him
Colby Condie
i feel like i haven't seen anyone in years. hangout very soon. a real hangout not a virtual google hangout
Tyson Amundsen
This is weekend
This weekend
Brayden Haws
Colby man, of course, let's hangout
Tyson Amundsen

Hey colby
Bryan Samuelson
Holy h
They'll be too good
He can play till he's 50
Colby Condie
holy crap
Bryan Samuelson
Serving in set pieces from a wheelchair
Colby Condie
I love Pirlo
haha bryan
Bryan Samuelson
Colby convince him to come play for rsl. For free
Colby Condie
i'll woo him in his native tongue to play here
Bryan Samuelson
Precisely. He can't say no to that. Tell him his family took you in to their home and fed and cared for you and your heart's only desire is to repay the favor
Colby Condie
he'll accept it no doubt. no doubt in my mind
Tyson Amundsen
You're not wrong. He'd instantly become the best free kick man in the league. And he would send long thru balls for days for zardes and Keane. He would take Donovan's place
Colby Condie
I mean the guy is a World Cup winner. He's a player. He ain't no scrub, Coach Coon!
Bryan Samuelson
He's just gettin beat like he stole somethin, that's all. He's just gettin beat! (says Bruce Arena whilst playing RSL)
Brayden Haws
Just posted in the event but I think we need to change halo to this Saturday as it's the General women's meeting that night and the weekend we have it on is conference weekend
Tyson Amundsen
Smart
Way smart
Colby Condie
http://m.espn.go.com/general/video?vid=11573457&src=desktop&ex_cid=sportscenterFB
Bryan Samuelson
Very smart. But I want to go to/watch the Utah game
Tyson Amundsen
When is the game?
Bryan Samuelson
A las 6:00
Brayden Haws
One screen for the game, one for halo
Espn3 on all laptops
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan won't go for the that
Bryan Samuelson
Haha Tyson's right
Brayden Haws
Bryan go for it
Utah hates us
They don't deserve our full attention
Tyson Amundsen
I move we scramble the MIGs
#commandandconquer
#redalert
And we do so by playing halo Saturday
Brayden Haws
I'll play
Colby Condie
I'll tell ya who really hate us. Jeff and Jared. Just never talk to us. No regard to anyone
Tyson Amundsen
Jeff is bad at the Google vox. But good outside of it. I've seen him recently at a game night and other hangout. And he got me a spicy set up so to speak. So I vote we replace him with Seth in the Google Enemy No. 2 slot
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
F him
Tyson Amundsen
R him right in the B
He's in a fight with Zach. He hasn't tweeted Zach's location in moons.
Brayden Haws
How does he ever get retweets or favs?

Peoples iphone 6 plus have been bending on their thighs
Tyson Amundsen

Holy gay Blake? Is he friends with Schumann?
I saw that haws
Brayden Haws
Dood I saw that
But also knowing the cynical blake I laughed, found it funny
Am I becoming Schumann?
Tyson Amundsen
No man. Cynical Blake is funny, so let's agree to call this misguided
Edward Ekstrom
Just updated halo
To this Saturday all
Bryan, we can watch the Utes dominate in unison.
Unison bonus.
Jeff Knudsen
Don't hate me, I am with you, I love you
Brayden Haws
I'm feeling skinny Jeff
Wednesday, September 24, 2014 7:26 AM

Tyson Amundsen
Is Grants wife really oregano?
Pregnant
Colby Condie
yup
Tyson Amundsen
No
Serious?
Colby Condie
yeah she posted it on instagram
Brayden Haws


Merit, props to us
Colby Condie
that's how to do twitter
show it to shoeman
Brayden Haws
Screw shoeman
Colby Condie
Haha
Brayden Haws
I just hate everyone but my friends
Merit Egan
Haws, that is a great app that reminds us of our roots.
Edward Ekstrom
Alright, who's not busy right now?
I have a topic for discussion.
http://www.dailytech.com/Apples+Lagging+Adoption+of+TokenProtected+NFC+Mistaken+For+Innovation/article36518.htm
Why do things not get widely adopted until Apple does them.
It bugs the crap out of me.
Brayden Haws
I would say brand status
Edward Ekstrom
F their brand.
Brayden Haws
Apple is associated with success and elitism
So if they do it everyone should
Edward Ekstrom
I just want my keys and wallet to be removed from my life.
Brayden Haws
and if they're not then why do it?
Edward Ekstrom
And it will never happen until Apple says so it shall be.
I think you're right Haws.  But I still hate it.
Brayden Haws
Oh they rule the world
Edward Ekstrom
I'm excited for Merit's perspective.
Merit Egan
It is quite annoying. I've been using ISIS for years, and now apple acts like NFC is all new. Tell that to barbacoa and Jamba juice who have given me hundreds of dollars worth of stuff via NFC.
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha I know
It is so annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!
But do you agree that now that Apple does it, way more stores will start accepting mobile payments?
It really chaps my aaaah
Merit Egan
Probably more will. But I also think Google holds enough clout that they had most of those stores that were willing to. More stores will adopt it as it becomes more popular. Now that the whole smartphone community can do it, it will grow.
The mobile payment companies just nearly doubles their potential users.
Edward Ekstrom
iPhone is half the US market of smartphones?
Holy cow, we're richer than I thought.
Merit Egan
It used to be more. I think it is probably around 40% now.
Brayden Haws
Or just have tons of debt
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
More likely.
F Apple.  All my crap is Apple and I still hate them.
Merit Egan
Everyone knows I hate Apple and love Samsung.
Edward Ekstrom
But yours is a practiced love.
My love changes with the tide.
Merit Egan
To slightly alter the topic, everyone is so obsessed with Apple vs. Android. That is not the argument. The argument is largely Apple vs. Google, and within Google there is the decision of which phone.
Edward Ekstrom
Yes.  I love Google.
so what is the topic.
Merit Egan
And eddy that is why it makes sense for you to have an iphone. If you have a mac and stuff, it makes more sense.
Brayden Haws
Right now I think I like apple, but soon I will hate it and love Samsung if merit has taught me anything
Edward Ekstrom
How long can Apple and Google coexist?
is that the question?
Merit Egan
The iPhone is no question a top 2 phone out there. I think Apple and Samsung lead the race. So then you just decide Apple or Google and you have your phone
Edward Ekstrom
Yes true.
I still like Apple computers better.
But it's not for good reasons.
It's because you can have all 3 OSs on a Mac and no other computer.
Merit Egan
Tell us
Edward Ekstrom
You can have OSX, Windows, and Linux on a Mac
i.e. any software in the world can be installed on your computer.
Merit Egan
Interesting. Will Windows ever have the ability to have OSX or will Apple protect it?
Edward Ekstrom
Apple will never allow it, in my opinion.
You can do it but it's very scetchy and illegal.
it's called a Hackintosh
Merit Egan
Haha
Gr8 name
Edward Ekstrom
True
Brayden Haws

Guys who even needs smartphones
Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Brayden Haws
Look what I just found
Edward Ekstrom
You can also have a virtual machine that runs Mac OS on it in windows.
But I don't like VMs
I like stuff running on my actually hardware, it's way faster and better.

Apple and Samsung are pushing people out.
And I feel like other has to be bogus.
How can almost 10% of people own a smartphone other than those?
Merit Egan
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
What even is there?
Brayden Haws
Motorola has a smartphone that is the one you can get for free with att
Edward Ekstrom
A raspberry pie phone?
Brayden Haws
Like the iPhone and Galaxy are 200 each when you sign up
Edward Ekstrom
I know, I'm talking about the other catagory?
category*
Brayden Haws
Oh the only one is the Nokia lumia
Edward Ekstrom
not (lg or htc or blackberry or motorola or samsung or apple)
Brayden Haws
That's like the main windows phones that has that huge camera on it
Edward Ekstrom
oh got it.
Merit Egan
The scary thing for Samsung is what happens when Google decides to cut off support to all manufacturers and make their own phone. They made their own phone last year, but pulled the plug on it this year. You have to think they'll do it again eventually.
Edward Ekstrom
So windows phones are not on that list?
Brayden Haws
Has like 40x zoom
Well HTc makes windows phones
But their main one is the lumia
Edward Ekstrom
okay
Brayden Haws
This kid on my class has it looks like it could be okay, if you have a windows laptop and or tablet to pair it with but no way as good as the main two
Merit Egan
Google is waiting for Samsung and Apple to wipe out the competitors and then they will jump in as phone provider #3, pull support from Samsung and then be #1 or #2.
Edward Ekstrom
So Apple sold 10 million phones opening weekend.
That's like $7,000,000,000 right?
7 billion
Colby Condie
Eddy how do I get Microsoft Office 2013 on my MacBook?
Edward Ekstrom
Install windows on your computer.
just type bootcamp into Spotlight search
It will guide you through it.
Colby Condie
If I get windows will it slow down my computer?
Is bootcamp better than Parallels?
Brayden Haws

Throwback Wednesday to when me and Teezr were strangebrew for Halloween
Colby Condie
Haws you were just massive back then
Brayden Haws
6 grade
Colby Condie
Kicking all the kids aaaahs in school
Brayden Haws
I was like 5'9"
and weighed like 175
Now I'm 5'11"
Edward Ekstrom
They are completely different Colby
Brayden Haws
A life of drug use and sex stunted my growth, I coulda been Shaq
Edward Ekstrom
Parallels is a VM
Alex Platis
Haha I definitely remember that costume. Nobody understood it.
Merit Egan
Spot on gentleman.
Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha oh yes!!
Brayden Haws
People didn't need to understand
It was too good for them
Tyson Amundsen
I had forgotten
Brayden Haws
So did I
It took me like ten minutes to figure out what we were supposed to be
Brayden Haws
Tyson can you give us a brief explanation of the expansion draft
?
I know we can protect 11 and homegrowns are automatically protected
So does that mean Javi, sabo and salcedo are auto protected?
Tyson Amundsen
Yes I can
Javier and Sabo are DPs
So idk if they are protected. I don't think so
Brayden Haws
Are dps not protected?
That's dumb
Tyson Amundsen
We will get 11 plus salcedo, Gil, Justin Glad, Lalo Fernandez (gk), Benji lopez
I don't think DPs are protected. But if they get drafted it must be at a dp level salary
Brayden Haws
So who do you think we protect: javi, Jamie, Joao, grabs, Kyle, schuler, Tony, Rimando?
Sabo?
We must keep Sabo
We have so many good forwards
We can't lose em
Merit Egan
Here's what I would do. Blue is auto. Green is for sure, then pick 4/6 yellow.
Wingert and Nat are old and can't warrant a protection. Although I like both.
Brayden Haws
We gotta keep Ned, he's too good
Merit Egan
I agree. He's only yellow cause of age.
Tyson Amundsen
So blue is definitely keep
?
Merit Egan
Teez, break down my selections. I am not as knowledgeable as captain teez.
Brayden Haws
Blue is auto protected
Tyson Amundsen
I don't get your system
Brayden Haws
Green is for sure
Tyson Amundsen
Oh
Brayden Haws
Yellow is who else we need to protect but we can't all of them
There's too many
Tyson Amundsen
Keep Olmes, luke, Tony, and Ned of the yellow
Jordan Allen is homegrown so we keep him
No matter how we do this I'm not happy. I guarantee Kreis picks someone
Likely Orlando city will too
Brayden Haws
We can only lose two roght?
I bet someone takes seba
Which is dumb, he's awesome
Tyson Amundsen
Correct. I'm not comfortable leaving Wingert unprotected because he and Tony are by far are two best outside backs. Unless rich Balcgan can get healthy or Jordan Alan or someone plays that as a homegrown
John Sherwood
He is way awesome. When does this happen?
Let wingert go
Tyson Amundsen
He has had a slower year than I would have expected from him. Part of that has to do with the appearance of Luke Mulholland. But the draft is I think the first week of December
I really don't know who would play outside back if we let winger to go. Maybe Salcedo but he likes central the fence
And I'm not sure that Justin glad is ready to play full time
John Sherwood
My offensive slip is showing. But I'd way rather lose wingert than bassy.
Brayden Haws
I feel like we have so many pieces to plug in offensively and Nat is losing it so I think Wingert and Tony are crucial for us to keep things together
Tyson Amundsen
I love offense also. Realistically like I said I don't want to lose anyone
Under the radar news was that Taylor Peay started for Portland yesterday
Brayden Haws
Wow
Tyson Amundsen
In CCL against a team from Guyana that they dominated.
It's huge he made the roster, and it will be a miracle if he makes it again next year
RSL could have signed him as a homegrown but we drafted two guys r instead
Neither of which made our roster
It's hard to make our roster. But Sandoval, Beltran, Seba, and Stertzer all managed
From the draft I mean
Tyson Amundsen

What is this about?

And this
Do we like bill Simmons?
John Sherwood
I really like bill. I'm nit sure what this is about though
Brayden Haws
On his podcast he challenged espn to suspend him
Cause he was saying how goodell and the NFL were liars
That they were trying to deny seeing the Ray rice tapes before it went public even though there are records that they had received it back in April
Merit Egan
Simmons is the man.
Tyson Amundsen
In other news my Google vox app just updated and is throwing me off
But we like Bill Simmons then
Brayden Haws
Yeah he's great
Good on tv and a way entertaining writer
Merit Egan
Great journalism here
The 2 foot Boomstick
Brayden Haws
http://wittyandpretty.com/2014/09/22/what-guys-really-think-about-your-high-waisted-shorts/
Some funny quotes on this
Alex Platis
Haws that is brilliant. Good find.
Tyson Amundsen
So can we pull halo this Saturday? John you've been quiet
Onky me eddy and haws have discussed it
Edward Ekstrom
I'm ib
In
John Sherwood
I don't know... possibly. Julia works til 7 so I have all morning/afternoon. I'm nit sure if we have planned Saturday night
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think it looks good eddy
Thursday, September 25, 2014 8:01 AM
Brayden Haws
Merit do you ever use your stylus with your phone?
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Holy Shiz I hate him
How does he have any followers? He never makes any good tweets
Edward Ekstrom
Wtf
John Sherwood
Ha it's because he worships Twitter. Every second he's trying to create a Bro tweet so they'll follow him
Merit Egan
Haha I hate Schumann
Haws I do use the stylus quite often. It has some good features.
Brayden Haws
Is it fine point? I need one for my tablet but I haven't been able to find any fine point ones except on Amazon for like 30 bones
That's a big investment
Merit Egan
It is fine point
Brayden Haws
Would you say it's worthwhile to have?
Merit Egan
I would. I enjoy it. Probably use it daily.
And when not in use it just hides
John Sherwood
1 more follower til I destroy instagram! #quarterpounders
Merit Egan
Haha
Go get em!
John Sherwood
So schumann has tweeted 8000+ times and has 1000 followers. Every 8 tweets he gets 1 follower
Ive tweeted 574 times. And have 123 followers. Thus every 4.66 tweets I get a follower. Mathematics.... I'm nearly twice as good as schumann
Not that followers matter. It's about human interaction. Human emotion. Did the pilgrims care how many followers they had? No. Did ghandi? No. Did kim k? Yes. How do you want to be remembered?
Brayden Haws
John you should send Schumann and email about this
All these facts
You'll destroy his gmail
John Sherwood
And his morale
Merit Egan
I'm sitting at 4.52. I feel good about that.
Meanwhile I have just destroyed instagram.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha the moneyball of twitter
You guys rock
Colby Condie
My ratio is 13.6

Is that bad? It's not good. But I care more about friend interaction and bashing Shoeman's twitter than followers
Brayden Haws
It's more fun to try and lose followers, me and collin used to always do that
Just randomly attack our followers
Edward Ekstrom
I have 2 tweets 13 followers.
13/2
ratio of 6.5
not ratio, sorry john.
every tweet I get 6.5 followers.
booyaaaa
1 : 6.5 would be a ratio.
Tyson Amundsen
My soccer tweets surely hurts my stats
Brayden Haws
Retweets will get ya
Edward Ekstrom
Moral of the story, ayooooo.
Merit Egan
I've not been very good at tweeting for the past few years. Is it time for me to resurrect Twitter?
Brayden Haws
Merit nothing brings more joy in life than Twitter
Except Carls he
Jr
Merit Egan
And those commercials
Colby Condie
I once was a very frequent tweeter. But I held back for fear that I was focusing on quantity more than quality
Maybe it is now time to fuse the two together and have a good tweet daily. Do a good tweet daily. Do a good turn daily.
Merit Egan
This is how I feel about twitter right now. #independenceday
Brayden Haws
Merit you are the multimedia king
All hail
Colby Condie

Third poop today. Whatever happened to everyone recording each poop?
Merit Egan

Tyson Amundsen
Hahaha merit we hail you
Incredible
Alex Platis
That is fantastic.
Tyson Amundsen
President Monson joined twitter
Glory Glory Hallelujah
Colby Condie
paid poops are the best
Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Thursday, September 25, 2014 9:23 PM
Brayden Haws
Quiet out here
Everyone must be getting some
John Sherwood
Important!! What are we doing this weekend?
Brayden Haws
Something fun I would hope
John Sherwood
I wouldn't mind a: bowling night, nickelmania night, borg night, body body night, etc...
A fine dining night
Brayden Haws
I'd like all of those
Edward Ekstrom
I would love all those things.
We've got halo from 6 to 8 on Saturday
Brayden Haws
Bowling is hard on
The weekends, always
Jammed up
John Sherwood
Let's start earlier. But yes I'll play
Brayden Haws
Let's go to dinner tomo
Tyson Amundsen
I'm seriously doubting halo Saturday. We don't have the commitment level. I think we just hangout with whoever can
We can't just ignore this eddy
Merit Egan
I'm in for halo
Tyson is in for halo
Eddy is in for halo
Haws is in for halo
Reed and spenny are in for halo
Colby is in for halo
Jared is in for halo
Jeff is in for halo
Bsam is in for halo
Tyson Amundsen
Haha merit you're an idealist
Bryan has said he won't play, for starters
How do I know that?
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
I'm for sure in
Tyson Amundsen
Because he specifically would not say he wasn't coming
Brayden Haws
May God bless us in this endeavor
Colby Condie
Tyson whether you say we can or we can't, you're right.
Merit Egan
Perhaps my best gif ever
Brayden Haws
Provoc
We gotta test this
Merit Egan
Haha
What is he trying to do?
Did he spill?
Brayden Haws
Oh he spilt
On purpose
Trying to spill his seed
Sick, too far, going to bed
Friday, September 26, 2014 9:54 AM
Brayden Haws

Just found this at school
Tyson Amundsen
Haha yes
Edward Ekstrom
I've never understood why people do that?
Write in bathroom stalls.
Any inputs?
Are they constipated and without a smartphone?
Bryan Samuelson
I've wondered the same thing myself
Edward Ekstrom
Are they gang members?
Bryan Samuelson
They're just bullies man
Edward Ekstrom
I see.
Brayden Haws
F them in the B
Bryan Samuelson
Haws I feel like we need to have sensitivity training. With Triple T
Brayden Haws
I don't have time for that
Edward Ekstrom
Haws doesn't have a sensitive bone in his body.
He's physiologically incapable of being sensitive.
He'll diamond cut your aaahhh just for crying.
Brayden Haws
Only time I got is time for putting pain on fools who don't know what time it it
Is
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Bryan Samuelson
Haha good
Colby Condie

That is Schumann. At the Zions branch I'm working at today
John Sherwood
You are in murray. State street
Zions recognition like a fox
Colby Condie
Attaboy John
Brayden Haws
So is it true that Steve Ballmer is making all clippers employees get rid of all apple products?
Merit Egan
Colby get a germ killing spray and spray it through the air in there
His gayness germs are in the air molecules.
Edward Ekstrom
So happy it's Friday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0
Edward Ekstrom
The pilot episode for Arrested Development is the funniest thing ever.
Brayden Haws
Any thing from arrested is the funniest
Edward Ekstrom
I'm rewatching them
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doCkO3-N8Rk
Brayden Haws
Anyone wanna do a fun, friendly friend dinner tonight?
Merit Egan
I'd like to do something
That's for sure
But has anyone else read/seen the news today about the lady in Oklahoma that got beheaded at work? Employee A gets fired, leaves, comes back and cuts random employee B's head off. WTF.
Edward Ekstrom
What?
Is she ISIS?
Brayden Haws
She said she wanted to join them I think
Edward Ekstrom
It was a man.
Some say he converted to islam
Merit Egan
It is disturbing
Samuel McConkie
The dude did it with a regular kitchen knife
Edward Ekstrom
Holy F
Brayden Haws
That's jacked
Merit Egan
Everyone freaking answer
Booooooooo

Edward Ekstrom
We're busy tonight.
Merit Egan
Movie night? I've got the following:
Secret Life of Walter Mitty
Jack Ryan
Jobs
Anchorman 2
Lincoln
Edge of Tomorrow
Brayden Haws
Those all sound great merit
I'd watch any of them
Merit Egan
The Fault in Our Stars #winner #pleasethewomen
Who has seen Draft Day? It's way good. I'd watch it again.
Brayden Haws
Al and bryan told me it wasn't good
Alex Platis
Draft Dat
Brayden Haws
Both of those films
Merit Egan
Why was Draft Day bad?
I wish to hear. I trust Al as a movie critic.
Alex Platis
Predictable, stupid gimmicky graphics, bad acting all around.
Merit Egan
And Bryan only likes the Hoosiers, you can't trust his movie judgement.
Brayden Haws
He should like frozen
Alex Platis
I liked the script a lot better. It was set in buffalo and the main character was in his 30s, not stupid Kevin Costner
Bryan Samuelson
As Rocky, Merit. Can't forget that one. My major complaint was the lack of a training montage.
Brayden Haws
Al just knows the real story
That's wHy he gets the big bucks
Merit Egan
Him being in his 30's would have made that gay love story more believable.
Alex Platis
Oh I don't got no big bucks
Merit Egan
Not "gay" love story literally. I meant gay in the figurative form.
It was a figuratively gay, straight love story.
Alex Platis
Merit's twist: Costner is just banging the head coach
Merit Egan
Haha
Al, what movie should we watch?
Godzilla was lame
Edge of Tomorrow was fantastic
Alex Platis
Edge of Tomorrow was really good. Although another one where the main character was like 22 in the script and then they cast Tom Cruise
Merit Egan
He played the role well. Ignorance is bliss.
Bryan, where are you tonight.
Alex Platis
Yeah it worked. It was just a different movie with him in it.
Merit Egan changed the topic to MovieCritics.com
Alex Platis
Now the chick? Hoochie mamma. I've never liked watching a girl sweat like that before
Merit Egan
Haha
Alex Platis
Emily Blunt
Merit Egan
Emily Blunt
Alex Platis
Smoke that blunt
Merit Egan
Played her role well
Just today's Xena Warrior Princess
Bryan Samuelson
Mertdog I'm not sure. I was gonna maybe invite a girl to hang out with us, but I don't know that a movie night is the scene. I barely know her. Or maybe it is. There's also a party at Hambone's that Kenyon Martin might be at
Merit Egan
I'm not sold on a movie night. I'm down for all and anything
Alex Platis
Bryan you gotta bang em all. It's like Pokemon.
Merit Egan
Al, did you ever see the Way Way Back?
Brayden Haws
Merit do you have that?
Alex Platis
It was meh
Merit Egan
I do have it
Alex Platis
Steve Carrell was a real bastard
Brayden Haws
I do wanna watch that
Bryan we wanna party with you
Merit Egan
I found it enjoyable. Made me laugh, think, and cry all at the same time. Except the cry part. Didn't happen.
What movie? #gifquiz
Brayden Haws
Alien
Alex Platis
Alien
Fug you haws for beating me
Merit Egan
Very good. I was hoping someone would say Aliens, cause that would have been sooooo wrong
Tyson Amundsen
Wow
Merit Egan
To find out what we should really do tonight, we really only need to ask ourselves one question: What is Schumann doing tonight?
Tyson Amundsen
A lot has happened and I'm confused
And ten do the opposite
Merit Egan
Of course we will do the exact opposite
Good teez
Brayden Haws
Tyson I don't see how you could be confused
This all makes sense
Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
Niiiice
Let's go to Terminus
Tyson Amundsen

Ayooo rocket pop
Haws unless I messed something it went straight to merit asking al about his thoughts on a movie that at hadn't been discussed
I did have to force shut my hangouts tho so it could have missed something
Merit Egan


Brayden Haws
So the real question is are we even gonna do anything tonight? Or just be gay like shoeman and stare at our phones all night hoping for retweets
Merit Egan
That is the real question. I will not be like Schumann
Bryan Samuelson
I'd like to do something, if it's invite friendly. Probably not movie night for me. Other options?
Alex Platis
Sexy pillow fight
Sexy sleepover
Sexy monopoly
Sexy FIFA
Gotta do something sexy for your lady Bryan
Merit Egan
Video call at 7:30. Everyone be prepared to answer.
Tyson Amundsen
I support Al
I can't be there merit
Alex Crawford
Spaceballs Merit!
Merit Egan
Well now I've just had two 1 on 1 video calls since I got off work.
Thanks Tyson and Al for being my friends.
Alex Platis
Productive call.
We decided on a sexy hot tub night so that Bryan can get sum.
Bryan Samuelson
Haha thanks guys, sorry I missed the call
Merit Egan
Who wants to go to the gem fair at the expo center tonight? I feel like we could make such a dumb fair quite fun.
Bryan Samuelson
How much monies?
Merit Egan
I dunno
Brayden Haws
Welp took a quick nap and I'm back
Everyone better go to merits at 830
Eveyone bring bryan

Edward Ekstrom
Halo at 6 too
Why the f is no one confirming
?
Bryan Samuelson
Hey guys I'm here, I'd play ball
John Sherwood
Halo at 6 is questionable for me... U game at 6. And body body tonight.. I think
Brayden Haws
Id play
Both
Merit Egan
All I can say is that the vox can never create solid plans.
Except if Carl's Jr. is involved.
Brayden Haws
Merit don't hate
At least we know we can get Carls at a moments notice
That's a great benefit
Merit Egan
We better go to Carl's Jr. tonight. 5:45.
Brayden Haws
You know I would go
Edward Ekstrom
So no basketball
Jeff Knudsen
So the U game is at 6 is that what everyone is doing around then? After party?
Edward Ekstrom
Halo!
At 6
With u game playing
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy failing to prepare is preparing to fail. We aren't prepared for halo
The plan is do what you want for the game and then body body
Edward Ekstrom
Why I don't get why everyone is being day
Gay
Tyson Amundsen
Eddy let's just play live
We don't have the numbers. People will system link
If we have numbers. But we don't. that time will come soon
Edward Ekstrom
Okay let's watch the Utah game at my moms or at my dads theater

Edward Ekstrom
Oh good. I thought you were meaning somewhere else
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws

Mixed in a blender
Brayden Haws
A pizza covered in Taco Bell
Shoved inside a fresh baked Carls bun
Merit Egan

Jeff Knudsen
Spicy chicken, little c, and Wendy's nugs
Brayden Haws
They also now have double and triples of the Texas burger now
I'd try that
Alex Crawford

I'm game for the game an Haws you can just put 2 gallons of butter on your burger. That'd be good.
My home teacher just dropped off 3 gallons of butter. I could spare you some.
Merit Egan
Haws, don't listen!
Carl's!
Brayden Haws
Crawdad I was expecting you to say you made that
That's the faith I have in you and the awesome things you do
Merit Egan
I need some brisket. I could also do a burger. Oh and some jalapeño crisps. Does anywhere around here make those all together?
Jeff Knudsen
I need to hear some commitment. Are we eating all for one or one for all?
That's it, I'm eating on my own
John Sherwood
When we rendezvous, are we going to watch the U game?
Tyson Amundsen

Brayden Haws
Saw that today tyson

"Students protest BYU beard restriction"
Merit Egan
I protested the beard restriction by transferring
Edward Ekstrom
I didn't have to protest beards, half the computer science professors had beards and didn't care if we did.

Colby Condie
Neil caught himself a big one. Via Facebook
Good haws

Colby Condie
Fish with a side of deer at his restaurant this week
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
I think I liked that
#RollNeil

Colby Condie
fun fact: Brady Johnson and his new wife are in our ward here in Sandy
Brayden Haws
The jags have the worst uniforms
And they're the worst
I can never take them serious
I even forget they are a real team
Colby Condie
i'm trying to think if i've seen their jerseys yet
post a pic haws
i'm not a fan of the Tampa Bay uniforms either
Brayden Haws

The helmet is shiny gold and then fades out towards the front and suddenly turns black
Merit Egan
Friends in the Sandy area. This lady in my ward is looking for a basketball teacher to teach kids how to dribble and shoot and what not. A lil basketball clinic that runs out of Albion on Friday mornings from 8:15-9:15. It pays $30 per class. Anyone interested?
John Sherwood
Dang that's be amazing. I want to.. But cant. Maybe in November I can, but that's be the easiest
Bryan Samuelson
Ha that is awesome. Unfortunately I also cannot
Tyson Amundsen
Bryan screw your period! You would love that beyond all others
Brayden Haws
Bryan if you do that, then John can go to your math class and we can set up a ferris buehler type dummy at his work, and that way everyone wins
Merit Egan
Haha it would be really easy.
zach fackrell

Tyson Amundsen

Amazing how gay his tweets continue to be
First response was a good one tho
Admit it bryan
Brayden Haws
Soooooo gay
Bryan Samuelson
Agreed. Well done D_Ricky1
Brayden Haws
Is he gay?
Tyson Amundsen
Way gay
Brayden Haws
Does he enjoy the warm embrace of a man?
Tyson Amundsen
He and gomez are bros now
Haha
I favorite the response tweet

Edward Ekstrom

John Sherwood
Wow, super gay tweet. I think if I pooped on my phone, a better tweet would come out
Merit Egan
I ask for Colby's forgiveness regarding my latest anti-MLB tweet. Thanks, Merit.
Brayden Haws
Merit great tweet
Merit Egan
I mean, I feel that it's true. Go to India and teach a kid to throw a football really well, and he'd probably die if he started at QB.
Colby Condie
Haha it's an interesting tweet topic merit.
Although those kids never actually made it to the MLB I would say it's rare that happens.
Merit Egan
That's true. And probably because they only learned how to throw.
Colby Condie
Honestly I think the hardest thing about baseball is hitting. Hands down
Merit Egan
I would agree.
Colby Condie
That's why a 30% success rate makes you an all star
Merit Egan
Perhaps it should have read, "is pitching hard?"
Colby Condie
It is funny though cause that movie just makes pitching seem like a walk in the park ha
Merit Egan
The movie just opened my eyes up to the combination of skill + mental. Obviously there is plenty of mental in baseball, but an NFL or college QB incorporates much more.
Not a good movie for pitchers
Edward Ekstrom
I but you could go to india and find a punt returner.
Super fast, super agile.
Or a Kicker.
Merit Egan
Or a team chef
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan

What movie is that from?
Edward Ekstrom
No idea
Merit Egan
Me neither
Edward Ekstrom
Probably one of his demon movies.
Merit Egan
True. Anyone in the greater Sandy/Draper area for lunch in an hour?
Edward Ekstrom
If you do it out by the freeway, I'm in
near point of the mountain.
But I know that is far.
I followed Creed on twitter for a bit.
Merit Egan
Let me look into it. I'm decently close.
Edward Ekstrom
But then I didn't understand half of his tweets.
So I unfollowed him
Merit Egan
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
And after I unfollwed him, he started following me.
Do you think he's trying to regain me as a follower?
Merit Egan
You're the one that got away. Now he's trying to win you back.

Wtf is happening? My phone was dead and I turned it on to just hundreds of notifications of numbers
Edward Ekstrom
Merit and I had 151 consecutive Google voxes.
Colby Condie
I have a poll for all of you: who mutes notifications on hangouts? I recently started doing it after Bryan showed me the light
Before I knew about that, I would just get a billion vibrations every day at work
Edward Ekstrom
I mute frequently.
zach fackrell
I'll be honesto. I really wanted you to get to 1,000
Edward Ekstrom
Me too
Merit Egan
We were close
I mute from time to time. When needed.
Colby Condie
i'm consta mute now
John Sherwood
I'm on mute
Tyson Amundsen
It used to let me snooze it for a period of time. That was fantastic. I could just snooze it for an hour then it would automatically turn back on
Edward Ekstrom
You can still do that.
Brayden Haws
How, that's how I like it but it doesn't show up on the newest update
Tyson Amundsen
I don't think I can snooze now. Just turn notifications off
Brayden Haws
Yeah I don't see anyway to snooze
I want there to be
Colby Condie
i've never seen the snooze thing. that would be way nice
Merit Egan
I remember the snooze. The snooze was good.
#bringbacksnooze
Tyson Amundsen
Why is gone merit
Is it
I didn't approve the update
It blows
Brayden Haws
It was way nice cause it would bring you back to the convo, whereas with mute you might forget to turn it back on and miss hours and hours
Edward Ekstrom
You snooze in the main part
Tyson Amundsen
You used to
Edward Ekstrom

See
Tyson Amundsen
I don't have that. Where are you going for that
Brayden Haws
Oh yeah if you go the the main page and click your icon it has a bell to click
But I don't like that, I want it in the convo
Edward Ekstrom
On the main paige that shows all your convos
Tyson Amundsen
There it is. I agree it's in a dumb place tho
Edward Ekstrom
click the very top
They hatin on me

Tyson Amundsen

Merit Egan
My biggest mistake ever was going to BYU instead of USU.
Brayden Haws
My biggest mistake was going to the U
And I'm still living it
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Merit Egan
Once upon a time I got offered a full ride plus housing to USU. I turned it down and went to BYU without scholarship. Of course I end up graduating from USU without scholarship/
Edward Ekstrom
recurring nightmare.
Holy shi.
Merit would just easily be a ten thousandaire by now.
Brayden Haws
I once had a scholarship to the U
Then I went on a mission and they lost my hold
Which lost my scholarship
Merit Egan
cause the U hates mormons
Edward Ekstrom
Fact.
And they hate Gender.
Gender is a spectrum to them.
Merit Egan
They are just trying to join westminster and liberal hipsters
westminster *as liberal hipsters
Brayden Haws
*Liberal ass hipsters
Edward Ekstrom
"I am 1/6 female and 4/6 Male, the rest is unicorn"

Merit Egan
Those grants are a thing of beauty. Until you expect to get it again and they screw you over and give you nothing
Brayden Haws
That's true I got a ton last year and like none this year
Merit Egan
I just happened to see Javi Morales at 7-11

Edward Ekstrom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewPburLEZyY
Colby Condie
Yeah Joao speaks terrible English. I had to use a ton of hand signals to communicate. I actually talked to Javi when I worked at RSL. His English is better than Joao's but still not great. Javi is one of the coolest guys though. Way nice and humble

Brayden Haws

He used to always torch RSL when he was at the Galaxy with Beckham
Brayden Haws
He tweets how bad their field is
He tried to win a promo contest for another teams fans
Tyson Amundsen
Haha I know. I love it. Calls it the way it is

Guys what's our weekend plans?
John Sherwood
St geezer
Going to run (watch) the st george marathon
Tyson Amundsen
I'm just trying to figure out when we're going to Carl's Jr. They got a new thick burger. I hope it's not the end of the bbq brisket one
Brayden Haws
I don't think it is, they had both last time we went
You got coups, we gotta go
zach fackrell
Coups (coupons)
Bryan Samuelson
Coups d'état
Tyson Amundsen

Front page
Edward Ekstrom
I'm down for Carl'
s lunch.
Jared Carter

Quick someone break the law so I can be your juror!
Tyson Amundsen
Boo yeah! A day off work and getting paid. Law and order. Protect and serve
Edward Ekstrom
Sweet!
I wonder why I never get jury duty!
John Sherwood
It's rare for someone to be jazzed about jury duty. We're a special breed
Tyson Amundsen
Tweet that John
That's good twitter. Original
Brayden Haws
I got it but I had to go on my honeymoon I was pissed
Edward Ekstrom
That sucks

Haha this exactly how I feel when I see a 14 year old with a go pro strapped to his helmet.
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Laughing out loud.
I love the ducks next to the kayak.
Tyson Amundsen
Haha that is good stuff
Brayden Haws

Tommmmy prepping for conference
Saturday, October 4, 2014 12:09 AM
Tyson Amundsen
Holy utah state
Merit Egan
That was one gay game. And awesome that Taysom Hill has a broken leg.
Saturday, October 4, 2014 8:45 AM
John Sherwood
I listened on 1160 and the announcers said probably 10 things that made me lol. My favorite: "this is a once in a lifetime moment for aggie fans"
Another favorite: "byu is playing their worst game, usu their best. It's the perfect storm"
Bryan Samuelson
Haha that's good stuff
Edward Ekstrom
BYU's backup qb thought the Aggies corners were on his team.
He threw 3/29 interceptions.
John Sherwood
It is definitely unfortunate that taysom broke his leg though.
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah I definitely feel
for him. Brutal
Merit Egan
You won't ever win when you lose your starting qb and then your backup throws 3 picks in one half. It's not like Taysom was tearing it up last night, but it would have been closer for sure.
Win when. Great combo of words.
Edward Ekstrom
For sure.
John Sherwood
Agreed
Did oklahoma throw interceptions when bradford was injured?
Edward Ekstrom
Also to blame, BYU secondary. Got beat deep too often.
That one dude literally got schooled out of his shoes by a double move.
Merit Egan
That's my other question. Did the USU qb play the game of his life, or did the secondary just suck . Every deep ball was on the money.
As for the Oklahoma game I don't know. I was en Un mission
Bryan Samuelson
I vote that Utah recruits the backup. Or just play one of our other 7 quarterbacks that's not Travis
Edward Ekstrom
Combination. He has a good arm but the receivers had beat their men by like 5 yards each time.
Brayden Haws
I think it was a combo of both, he's played great in relief of chuckie but last night he was unreal and byu was awful
Edward Ekstrom
Haha yeah. Sad last 7 days for the state of Utah football
Brayden Haws

This should cheer everyone up
Edward Ekstrom
Our special teams and defense just scores more touchdowns that Travis could score in two lifetimes.
Merit Egan
I'm mostly sad for Taysom. Even if BYU went undefeated, we weren't going anywhere. Taysom was regarded as a legit hiesman finalist and now he's out for the year.
Edward Ekstrom
than*
Yeah, he's a nice guy too. Married my neighbor's little sister.
Too bad he had to break a leg.
Someone should have told him to break a leg before the game, then this never would have happened.
Merit Egan
Haha. Break a leg Taysom.
John Sherwood
Haha that's great. Tweet that shiz
"I bet the guy who told Tayson to 'break a leg' feels like crap today"
Brayden Haws
The game was so crazy it caused tyson to favorite one of Schumanns tweets
zach fackrell

Hahah Cody Lundgren likes more than schumans tweets..
Brayden Haws
Holy shiz
Cody is the worst
Merit please go report that tweet
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
I feel I need to do the occasional nice thing like favorite a tweet if his. Because at some point he will see us again at Zach's and I will have to pretend we were just joking
And it wasn't a bad tweet
zach fackrell
Have a good conference everyone!

I'm boarding my flight to Cincinnati then to Paris then to Venice. 24 hours straight
Tyson Amundsen
I'm encouraging his positive behavior as well as discouraging his bad behavior
zach fackrell
Good teez
Tyson Amundsen
It's cognitive psychology
zach fackrell
Do a good turn daily
Tyson Amundsen
Dude I was on a plane for six hours and I hated it. Idk how you do it
What will you do the whole time
Also great football chat last night everyone
Or was that this morning?
Idk
zach fackrell
I've strategically pulled and allnighter in preparation. Also ambien and movies and books
Brayden Haws
This morning
When we start right it's easy to go right all day
Tyson Amundsen
Smart move Zman
Brayden Haws
Zach have a fun trip, we'll go see all the cool movies when you get back
Tyson Amundsen
Dudes do we want to watch utah play post priesthood?
Or something of the sort?
Brayden Haws
Yeah I do
Watch us get our brains bashed out
Bryan Samuelson
Yeah man. I'm in. Even if we suck
Edward Ekstrom
Yeah man
Tyson Amundsen
And that is why I love Christofferson
Him and elder oaks. They are the jam
Edward Ekstrom
That talk was awesome.
Brayden Haws
And that is how it's done
Edward Ekstrom
"Have the husks been removed?"
"No"
"Well then drive on"
Colby Condie
Got called into work in park city today. Sucks
Brayden Haws
I didn't even know they had banks in park city
Christophersons Gravity example was great
#physics
#NeilTyson
Bryan Samuelson
I love the principle of justice and mercy. And that example was perfect
Tyson Amundsen

Tyson Amundsen
Buckle up
Edward Ekstrom
Gayness is not Godliness
I take it back and ask the X for forgiveness
Edward Ekstrom
Best session in the last few years, in my opinion. Callister is next 12
Brayden Haws
I think David Evans
He speaks at like every conference
Tyson Amundsen
Callister is cool. He was a mission president of a friend from ufs. He's told me way cool stories of him
Why is there Spanish voice over?!?!
Brayden Haws
They need to just do the translation and not the Spanish in the background
Or preferably just english subtitles
Tyson Amundsen
There is supposed to just be subtitles!
Brayden Haws
That's how it was earlier for the Cantonese giy
Guy
Tyson Amundsen
Gay
Brayden Haws
You can't even hear what's going on
Tyson Amundsen
I was looking forward to this
Brayden Haws
This is breaking my brain
Tyson Amundsen
It's obviously still good but still
I'm upset and we know bryan is weeping somewhere
There you are
Can you believe this?
Brayden Haws
Bryan are you mad?
Tyson Amundsen
Bummer
Brayden Haws
I can't even focus
I don't even sneak spanish but I'm upset
Bryan Samuelson
Dudes clearly I plugged into the computer to listen in Spanish for that one
It was great
Edward Ekstrom
Awesome
Tyson Amundsen
How does that work?
Brayden Haws
Are we gonna watch party after conf?
Saturday, October 4, 2014 8:04 PM
Tyson Amundsen

Halftime interviews are the worst
Also this should be said- I love the music of conference. But whoever arranged the priesthood music was too creative for my taste
Brayden Haws
Tyson my thoughts too, sometimes they just do too much, it's more distracting than good at that point
Tyson Amundsen
I'll go further. Honestly I thought it was pretty bad
John Sherwood
Ooooooohohohohohohoh yea

Ooooooohohohohohohoh yea
Bryan Samuelson
Ooookkayyyy!
Edward Ekstrom
Gaaaaay
John Sherwood
That was a huge swing
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
That could be the game
I blame it all on that if we lose
Merit Egan
What happened?
Edward Ekstrom
We picked it off in the red zone but roughed the passer and got it called back
Merit Egan
Ahhhhh that sucks. Was it at least a legit call, or was it a bail out?
Reminds me of BYU do8ng their surprise onside k8ck and getting it, then some d bag was offsides
Edward Ekstrom
It was legit I think.  I don't know I was listening on radio
but we just scored.
Man, how did he drop that pass?
Bryan Samuelson
Woof
Come on offense
#believe
#unity
John Sherwood
We need it # believe
Brayden Haws
Bryan I hope
You got all kinds of crazy clothes on
Setting neighbors cats on fire
Eating cinnamon bears
Edward Ekstrom
Wow scott is blowing it
Two easy catches dropped.
Bryan Samuelson
I don't care if you catch it for me, just catch it
Edward Ekstrom
Seriously.
Man I love our d line
Holy crap
Colby Condie
There was Halliday on TV. Brighton
Edward Ekstrom

Bryan Samuelson

Brayden Haws
This can't happen to us again
Bryan Samuelson
Everyone in. We can do this. We have Kendal. We have Devontae. Good vibes.

Brayden Haws
Booker

Edward Ekstrom
Holy goodness that was huge
I love him
and his beautiful legs
Brayden Haws
I don't like that
Colby Condie
That was stupid
Why not at least take a shot at the corner of the end zone for a TD?
Brayden Haws
Or just give to booker again he's on fire
Colby Condie
If it's incomplete there's no harm
Brayden Haws
If he doenst get a first, then just kick it
Edward Ekstrom
definitely should have ran it
try to get the first
Brayden Haws
Everyone pray
Edward Ekstrom
bull shiz
after all of the refs efforts, we still win
Bryan Samuelson
AYOOOOO UTAHHHHH!

But the truth will prevail!
Sunday, October 5, 2014 11:46 AM
Colby Condie
Great talk by Tommmmy #LDSConf
Bryan Samuelson
Agreed. I also thought it was super cool how Pres. Eyring said don't take for granted the feelings of love you have for the prophet
Brayden Haws
Thomas S Monson
Colby Condie
Yes haws yes Bryan.
Sunday, October 5, 2014 3:49 PM
Bryan Samuelson
Stellar talk from Elder Bednar
John Sherwood
Agreed. That'll be in reference to for years to come
Edward Ekstrom
Yup. I loved his story
Let's go spread the ointment, boys.
Al, you should get baptized.
After you read the book of Norman and pray to know its true
John Sherwood
Normans book is the prequel to the book of mormon. Think of it like star wars
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Well, a close of a great conference.
My brother-in-law has an awesome habit. He listens to the most recent session on his thirty minute commute to and from work each day. He has them all basically memorized
Tyson Amundsen
I usually put my favorite two or three talks on my I pod. I now have an awesome collection of talks dating back six years or so
Brayden Haws
When I used to drive from Sandy I would do that, great way to start the morning, then I wouldn't swear at the drivers around me being idiots
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Tyson Amundsen
Attention everyone: seth has a girlfriend
#aggiepots
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooooooo
I wish there was an app that ranked hangouts participation
Let's see how we think the rankings go
Brayden Haws
Seth
Tyson Amundsen
I could put it in tiers eddy
Top tier: me haws merit eddy and premarital colby
Brayden Haws
Honored
Tyson Amundsen
Middle tier: non traveling zach, John, post marital colby
Bottom tier: Bryan Al Crawdad Sam Seth Jared
I'd add Schumann to the middle tier based on his non consensual screen shot participation
Tyson Amundsen
Ball don't lie!! #RSL
John Sherwood
Balchan played trrrbly. #barkley
Tyson Amundsen
Yup. Bizarre game. I've been watching the second half. We could do whatever we want in this game but we haven't been dangerous at all
John Sherwood
Agreed.
Merit Egan
Boozer Eating Pizza: http://youtu.be/vdUBf1ZlODY

Tyson Amundsen

Edward Ekstrom
Hahaha
Tyson Amundsen
Attention all: looking for something to do on a Sunday night? Look no further! Chill time at Seth's house at 9 so we can tell him whether he should keep dating his girlfriend
Bryan we want you
Colby Condie
Tyson I commit to being upper tier post marital
Bryan Samuelson
I refuse to believe that I'm lower tier. I'm clearly middle tier
Tyson Amundsen
Good colby. Good bryan. You have both responded well to this. In no way is my list definitive- I encourage a healthy discussion on the tiers
Edward Ekstrom
I agree. Bryan is mid to upper tier
Brayden Haws
I feel like if it's quality then bryan is high up
Quantity he's probably mid
Edward Ekstrom
Who takes home the wein shaped rock as being most active?
Bryan Samuelson
Haha I appreciate that guys
Edward Ekstrom
I would say me and merit are tied for most active.
What other two members have had over 100 consecutive, uninterrupted voxes?
Also, I like how Jeff wasn't even mentioned
Jeff Knudsen joined the conversation
Edward Ekstrom
Jeff, why did you leave us?
John Sherwood
I want ti be considered for a tier above mid and a tier below top.
Also ju and I are going to the temple a la Wednesday at 6. Anyone may join
Jeff Knudsen
Are you doing a session Wed?  I was planning on going that day as well.
John Sherwood
Yes a session
Jeff Knudsen
OK I'll keep you posted if I can go at that time
Colby Condie

Wein shaped rock as Eddy mentioned
Tyson Amundsen
I can go to a session Wednesday is it is after 7
Brayden Haws

Tyson man, you've been reading the Old Testament
You know about this
Tyson Amundsen
Haha holy crap man. I was reading for a long time but then I needed to take a break and I been reading the book of mormon . So I pick up the old testament again probably around New Years. But I don't remember that reference that's for dang sure
Brayden Haws
Saw it quoted in an Amazon review for a bible
Tyson Amundsen
From what book? I find it hard to place
Brayden Haws
Ezekiel
Tyson Amundsen
You guys. I suck balls.
Idiot
That was crawford on my phone
Jeff Knudsen left the conversation
Jeff Knudsen joined the conversation

Monday, October 6, 2014 6:50 AM
Brayden Haws
Al man that's why we need you in here more, you have great comments
Brayden Haws
Also John im in for weds, I believe the women are planning as well so I told Kase to sign us up
Monday, October 6, 2014 10:54 AM
Tyson Amundsen
John and eddy I have a math problem
Edward Ekstrom
Shoot
Tyson Amundsen
I have a history test this week. There is a list of essay questions we need to prepare for. There are 5 possible prompts. only 2 essays will appear on the test, and I will be required to answer only one
Therefore how many prompts should I actually study?
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
All of them!
Tyson Amundsen
No that can't be right
Bryan Samuelson
Study only 4
Tyson Amundsen
I think the answer is for
Four
Yes bryan. Cuz if I study three and the other two are on there I'm hosed
But if I study 4 of 5 I'm guaranteed to know one of the prompts
Bryan Samuelson
Precisely
Tyson Amundsen
Interesting medical school fact I gathered from staying with Zac Carter in DC
He says he was told by another student that it's impossible to know all the material for his tests. All you have to do is know 50% of it and then have a few areas of special interest
And that will be how you get good grades
Because they can't test you enough on all of it
And then down the road when you pick a specialty you can be assured of knowing all that
It's the same thing I'm doing for my history test
There must be a name for this kind of reasoning
Edward Ekstrom
But if you study all of them and you get two, one of them could be way harder
So you want to make sure the 4 you study are the easiest ones
And to find out which one is hardest you have to study them all
Merit Egan
If you study 1 of them, you have a 40% chance of knowing 1 of the 2. Study 2 and you have a 70% chance. Study 3 and you have a 90% chance.
Are you a gambling man?
If so, I'd study 3.
If you're a gambling addict, you'd probably study 2.
If you're a gambling fool, you'd study 1.
Tyson Amundsen
How accurate are those percentages?
I would gamble for 90%
Especially since to some extent I can predict which ones are likely to be there
Example: there aren't likely to be two essay questions from the same chapter on the test
Merit Egan
There are 10 possible combinations. 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5.
Tyson Amundsen
So is true then that preparing for only 3 gives me a 90% chance?
Brayden Haws
Tyson what class is this for? I had a class just like that before, I would always just study the hardest two the most cause likely one of them will be on it and then the easier ones just skim over cause usually if you just understand it generally you can bs a good andaer
Answer
Tyson Amundsen
Oh yeah I'm not worries
I'm just trying to think smarter not harder

I'm pretty sure this is calling out zach
Brayden Haws
I think you're right
John Sherwood
Merit is right. 90% and since you can anticipate 2 questions not being together. I'd study 3
Edward Ekstrom
Good work guys.
Never study hard for general education classes.  They should just have awesome lectures so you can learn cool stuff but never make you do anything outside of class.
Let's start our own college.
Like the movie accepted
Merit Egan
We'll call it Xcerpted
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Nice.
Merit Egan
Edward thanks for recognizing my top tierness in your rankings.
I recognize yours as well.
Edward Ekstrom
Only a fool could do otherwise.
Tyson Amundsen
Wait when did eddy do rankings?
Edward Ekstrom
I didn't do a full set of rankings.
I just said I thought #1 overall was a tie between me and merit.
And I used our 150 uninterrupted voxes as a testament.
Merit Egan
Haha. And tyson I app4eciate your full ranking
Edward Ekstrom
#1 eddy and merit
#2 haws
#3 tyson
#4 zach colby bryan john
#5 everyone else
Merit Egan
Al is climbing the ranks lately.
Edward Ekstrom
He is.
But we need to see some sustained participation in order to move him up the ranking.
Brayden Haws
Great to be on here guys
One thing that happens to me on here a lot that bothers me is that my phone basically acts like the discussion is muted, it won't show me every message and then I open the convo to find a lot of surprise ones
Does that happen to anyone else?
Erstwhile I've had hiccups for like 3 hours so I just left school
Erstwhile I've had hiccups the last 3 hours so I just left school
Merit Egan
Erstwhile I've had hiccups the last 3 hours so I just left school
Erstwhile I've had hiccups the last 3 hours so I just left school
John Sherwood
Just interviewed for a promotion at work boys. I'm still in training so it's not likely.. but fingers crossed
Tyson Amundsen
Well done Juanito. Buena suerte

Remember when Seth was wearing my company shirt?
He got it at the DI
His is cooler than mine.
I demand a trade, seth.
As if he'll ever read this.
Colby Condie
Haha yeah i remember that ed
Also, I find it ludicrous I'm ranked at #4 out of 5 on the frequent voxer list. I demand a recount
Edward Ekstrom
You think my list was off?
Brayden Haws
Eddy can't you just make a program to track that for us?
Edward Ekstrom
You're right.  maybe you are with haws or tyson at #2 or #3
Colby Condie
Ok I'll accept #3
Edward Ekstrom
Haws, I'm working on it
If someone will take the time to scroll all the way to the beginning of the chat and send me a text file, I will write the code.
Promise.
or you can kick me in the balls.
Colby Condie
Yeah eddy you can create a program that auto counts the number of voxes per day (V/D). then take into account the number of "haha"s that follow it. that will measure quality of voxes (qV). then the length also. it's bad to have too many long ones cause no one wants to read only way long ones. sometimes simple is better
Edward Ekstrom
The easiest way is to go to gmail and find our hangout in there
then click the scroll wheel on your mouse and then just move the pointer up
then it keeps scrolling without you having to do anything.
I just let mine scroll for about two minutes without touching it and I'm only at the cow with the hair blowing in the wind gif that merit sent.
Colby Condie
haha
what month did we initiate the merger from Voxer to hangout? was that this year even?
Edward Ekstrom
I think it was last year
But, I'm committed guys
I'm already back to August
I'm going to quote a vox, let's see who can determine who said it
The person can't guess their own
"Anderson the dang phone people"
"Answer"
Colby Condie
Eddy said that
Edward Ekstrom
Nope
Colby Condie
tyson
Edward Ekstrom
Just passed pics from Colby's wedding
Yup it was Tyson
Colby Condie
ayoo
Edward Ekstrom
Just passed a screenshot of Chris Amundsen getting Instagram
Just passed a pic of sunset peek from Tyson
Colby Condie
haha i bet we've covered thousand of topics
Edward Ekstrom
Just passed tysons American flag speedo pic
Just passed a pic of a Pokemon vw bug
22 July everyone
I'm awesome
This act of service moves me to the soul owner of the #1 spot
Sorry merit
Brayden Haws
God bless you Eddy
You are hereby appointed to technology patriarch
Rather patron saint of technology
John Sherwood
Haha amazing. We should be famous guys
Famous guys, guys
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Xactware isn't paying me enough to do this.
Colby Condie
eddy how are you scrolling way back but still sending messages?
Edward Ekstrom
I'm going to ask for a raise
Sending on my phone
Scrolling on my work computer
"Hey boss, I spent two hours writing code to see who uses google hangouts at work the most out of my friends. Can you pay me more?"
Colby Condie
aahh ..  C
Edward Ekstrom
June 15 everyone
Colby Condie
*slow clap* Eddy.. eddy.... Eddy... Eddy!! Eddy!!!! EDDY!!!
John Sherwood
What is the conversation about ed?
Edward Ekstrom
Who send a picture of a drawing that said I lost my phone and my keyboard is broke?
I don't know john, already at May 29th
I can send the full transcript to everyone. For your own records
Colby Condie
zach lost his phone
Edward Ekstrom
Good Colby
Colby Condie
I'm 2 for 3
Edward Ekstrom
Who sent a picture of a koala bear driving saying "don't worry, I'm koala-fied "?
Made it to April everyone.
Holy cow we vox a lot
Colby Condie
c'mon people who sent the koala bear
Edward Ekstrom
Who sent the picture of their crazy Macklemore hair?
Brayden Haws
Zach
The hair
I'm guessing merit for the bear
Edward Ekstrom
Good haws
I'm in February
Colby Condie
didn't i do the bear?
Brayden Haws
Eddy! Eddy! Salt Lake! (Chant)
Edward Ekstrom
Haha thanks haws
Yes you did Colby. -3 points for guessing your own.
So will everyone accept this year as an acceptable ranking system?
Or do I have to go all the way back, jack?
Brayden Haws
Yeah that's a good sample size
Edward Ekstrom
How about I go to last October?
That is even better
A 12 month period
Colby Condie
wait haws guessed the bear first. i had to correct the mistake. +3 pts for correcting
Edward Ekstrom
Okay, I uphold your motion.
Man, February was an active month.
Edward Ekstrom changed the topic to Who is #1
Brayden Haws
People paying tribute to my birthday no doubt
And romantic valentines convos
Edward Ekstrom
I did see that
Who said happy birthday higgenbottom?
Who changed the name of the con to "we don't talk about stocks because teez/haws will piss their pants if we do"
Brayden Haws
Merit did the stick
Bryan Samuelson
Merit
Haws beat me by a whisker. This is a revolutionary idea Ed. The kind of forward thinking we need in America
Edward Ekstrom
Who sent a picture of everyone playing banana grams at zach's when he was dating tmal?
I'm almost to last year
Bryan Samuelson
Was that the time we set a thousand pictures? Pictures in picture?
Edward Ekstrom
I don't know, I only got a small glimpse into that world.
Colby Condie
yeah i think we all sent pics at some point
Edward Ekstrom
I wonder if Google is going to cut me off at some point
Colby Condie
that is so much memory on our phones. i wonder how much of that is saved on our phones
Merit Egan
Can you calculate the difference in voxes per day by premarital colby and postmarital colby? Then apply that formula to my voxes. I can't imagine how active premarital Merit would have been.
Edward Ekstrom
Yes, I can do all of this
Colby Condie
then we must calculate the post marital colby with the regular marital colby. the first few months are adjusting period
Edward Ekstrom
Colby, nothing gets stored on your phone
Brayden Haws
Merit its sad we didn't have this technology before you were married
We'll never get those memories back
Merit Egan
Those memories are ones I'll never have. And because of that, I can't remember them.
Brayden Haws
All I remember is putting angry birds on my phone for Kelli to play so we could fêęf all day
My phone just auto corrected feef to that for the first time ever
Colby Condie

Tyson Amundsen
I get to play indoor soccer for the first time since the semester started. You know I will be looking to chip the keeper
Any and every chance I get

I still have dreams of that chip shot you had
Tyson Amundsen
As do I. Prime cut beef
Brayden Haws

I'll tell my grandkids about that one
Brayden Haws changed the topic to It's Not About The Vox by Brayden Haws

Haws do you only need one testicle to vox?
Tyson Amundsen
Haha
Well done to you bo TN
Brayden Haws
Just as long as you got a ton of steroids
Alex Platis
And you are a lying sack of shit. Those are the two requirements
Tyson Amundsen
Haha wait what? Did I miss something?
Brayden Haws
What?
Al?
Why are you mad?
Alex Platis
I'm talking about Lance. Settle down children.
Tyson Amundsen
So you are saying the two requirements are to have two noogs. Or what are the two requirements
Alex Platis
Steroids snd being a lying sack of crap
Brayden Haws
Oh now it all makes sense
Alex Platis
I feel like I'm talking to Radio here. Or another equally slow member of the vox.
Tyson Amundsen
I feel like you weren't being entirely clear if both haws and I didn't get it
Alex Crawford
I thought all was mad too.
Can you still watch jazz games on the non cable tv option or is it reserved for cable buyers now?
Brayden Haws
I think the preseason some games are on kjazz
Edward Ekstrom
I got it Al
Alex Platis
See? Even Eddy got it.

Annie's sister is in town from NY so I'm out for tennis
Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Tell Brooke foster to give you a discount
Merit Egan

She's a girl
That works there
We know her
Some of us tried to "know" her
Merit Egan
What does she look like.
Brayden Haws
Tall as me
Way tan

Dang I'm on CST with the vox today. Forgot to check it. Merit get the Capricciosa at Settebello. That's my personal favorite.
Merit Egan
I'll tell my waiter immediately
Colby Condie
goood
Merit Egan
I got the Settebello at Settebello
I felt like it was a safe choice
Colby Condie
That's a good one too. my other choice actually
John Sherwood
Get the scopa
Merit Egan
It was very good
Colby Condie
ha good john
Brayden Haws
So tyson, chivas was just so bad the league bought them and shut them down?
#nonfoodvox
Colby Condie
if anyone else understands john's "scopa" reference, you win 10 points. go.
Merit Egan
that game that we played with the cards
Colby Condie
merit wins
Merit Egan
it was called scopa?
Colby Condie
yup
Merit Egan
and the settebello was one of the cards?
meaning beautiful?
Colby Condie
precisely
settebello is the most valuable card in the deck. settebello means "7 beautiful" to be exact
Merit Egan
and scopa means "butt toucher" which in turn translates into "Jared"
Colby Condie
referring to 7 gold coins on the card
haha
that was funny. too bad Jared will never see that joke cause he never checks the vox
Brayden Haws
Great vox merit
Life is passing Jared by and he's not even taking the time to stop and look at it
Jared Carter
Guys somehow I just happened to look at the vox at the exact time that there is a comment with my name in it #blessed
And there's a game that I'm in. #holyfu imblessed
Tyson Amundsen
Haws it's tough to say with Chivas. There's a lot wrong there. It was definitely an eyebrow raising decision in the first place with how they tried to make it like mexico usa
Weird
All I know is chelis was the greatest
Brayden Haws
He was great
Rsl should find a place for him
Tyson Amundsen
Yep. He's head coach of Puebla in Mexico now. He made news recently by making his players participate in drills while wearing wolf masks

Tyson, bryan is most definitely not lower tier.
he is mid tier.
Brayden Haws
After bryan there is such a dramatic fall off
Sad, wish all our friends would be on here more
Edward Ekstrom
Me too haws, me too....
Merit Egan
Bryan is hanging on to the middle tier, but just barely.
Edward Ekstrom
Of the active participators, he is definitely last.
John, have you worked in Python since school or did you have to use it for your math classes?
Bryan Samuelson
I'm determined to prove myself worthy of middle tier status
Edward Ekstrom
For everyone in the chat, Python is the coolest programming language out there.
It's like JavaScript and C++ made a beautiful object oriented yet functional programming language.
Baby.
Missed a key term there.
Brayden Haws
Bryan man
We want you here with us
We want you in the top tier
Bryan Samuelson
I'm here man. I'm in class but I'm here, honey badger don't care
Merit Egan
The top tier is open to all. Didn't your mom ever tell you that you can have more than one best friend?
That's what it's like with the top tier
There is no limit on how many people can be in the top tier, but you have to have the top tier traits.

Merit Egan
Tyson has the longest average vox, followed closely by seth
Edward Ekstrom
No, Crawdad
His average length is 136 characters
it's much more readable my program prints it out.
Merit Egan
woah, didn't see that one
well done crawdad. You don't use it often, but when you do, you make the most of it
Edward Ekstrom

There's the top performers.
Tyson could arguably be number one
Since he has sent more characters
His average vox length is much longer than haws'
BTW it counts it as one vox if you send multiple in a row.
Merit Egan
certainly an argument to be made. Is the champion based on quality or quantity?
Edward Ekstrom
I could do it differently if we want
if we said every individual vox is it's own
what do you guys think?
I will implement colby's idea next
which is see who has the most haha's int he vox immediately following their vox.
Merit Egan
I like how it is. prevents manipulation
Edward Ekstrom
I agree, that's why I did it this way
I could add the other stat too, as a side statistic.
Merit Egan
let's see who has the most haha's. that would be funny

Merit Egan
Haws is the true champion on here
Brayden Haws
Merit man, I work for you
Therefore when I win you win
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Brayden Haws
So does Eddy
Presidency stats sharing
Edward Ekstrom
Just the best piece of software I ever wrote.
Merit Egan
haha

John Sherwood
Haha
Merit Egan
I just hijacked a haha from eddy
John Sherwood
That haha was made for ed, yet merit swooped
Merit Egan
haha
John Sherwood
Haha for merit
Merit Egan
haha  for john
Edward Ekstrom
Dangit merit
Merit I have the power to start you at -1 and me at 1
Merit Egan

Edward Ekstrom
To get that laugh back
Merit Egan
start haws at -100
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Brayden Haws
Whoa merit you just want me to fail
Merit Egan
you're right haws. I'm sorry
Edward Ekstrom
There are two ways to have the tallest tower in town
By building yours up, or ripping others down
Merit Egan
that is a wise vox ed
Can we make a wise vox stat
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Brayden Haws
10 wisdom points to Eddy
Edward Ekstrom
We could see who says wise after someone's vox
Merit Egan
i think we should create a scoring system
Edward Ekstrom
What do you propose?
Merit Egan
(total voxes * (Haha - typos)^2) divided by 1090\
100
Edward Ekstrom
It's your vpi
Vox proper index
Merit Egan
haha
i just lol'd
Edward Ekstrom
Ayooo
Merit Egan changed the topic to You're The Real VPI MVP
Brayden Haws
Guys I love our friends
We're the coolest
Edward Ekstrom
Annie and I ate at este last night. I give it an 8
Has anyone else eaten there?
Bryan Samuelson
Is that a pizza place?
Edward Ekstrom
Yup
We went pre temple with John and Julia
Alex Platis
Haha
Edward Ekstrom
Me and John are the most righteous in the vox
Alex Platis
(I'm late to the party)
Merit Egan
when rating places (or anything), we should use the zero scale.
Bryan Samuelson
K I've been there, can't remember how well I like it
Merit Egan
basically, anything under a 5 doesn't get rated, so a 0 is a 5
John Sherwood
What's the prize?? (Rating scale?)
Merit Egan
scratch that, a 5 is a 0
Bryan Samuelson
The top prize!
Merit Egan
0=5, 1=5.5, 2=6, 3=6.5, 4=7, 5=7.5, 6=8, 7=8.5, 8=9, 9=9.5, 10=10
cause i don't eat at places less than a 5 unless i make a mistake, and i won't make it public
example: I got the BEEF STROGANOFF at Olive Garden. It was a 4.
that should never be said
Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Pizza could be the only food that tastes as good or better after being reheated.

Merit, let me know if that works.
Brayden Haws

Merit Egan

Brayden Haws
Haha
Haha
Edward Ekstrom

Brayden Haws
Haha
Edward Ekstrom

Merit Egan
set an auto run for every day
Brayden Haws
I'm paying you in hahas
Edward Ekstrom
That would be hard.
Merit Egan
eddy say something so I can also pay you in hose
those
Edward Ekstrom
because I have to copy all the new text into the file that I'm scanning.
Merit Egan
haha
Edward Ekstrom
Just did an update.
If you refresh the page, you will see the difference
Did anyone check out the whole conversation file.
Brayden Haws
Eddy I like everything you're doing right now, I don't know anything about computer science, except that it kicks Ah and you kick its Ah
Edward Ekstrom
It does kick Ah.
I just wish I could automate the copying of the most recent text.
If I could do that, I could set it to run on a schedule and never have to look at it again.
Colby Condie
is it possible to see who has the records for longest tenure of a chat name change eddy
Merit Egan

Colby Condie

Edward Ekstrom
Haha
Alex Platis
Computer science question: i torrent all the shows I watch. But I use a VPN. Can I ever get caught?
Brayden Haws
Al great question
Merit Egan
Al, that is a great question. From what I understand, no you cannot.
I need to use a VPN, what's the easiest way to do that?
I see apps that do it
Tyson Amundsen
What is a VPN
Alex Platis
I will let eddy explain. I don't want to mess it up
But merit my friend subscribed to one. It's like 40 a year but up to 4 devices can use the log in at once
I think it's called Private Internet Access
Merit Egan
interesting. It's time to invest.
Tyson, a VPN connects you to the internet through a virtual IP address so it isn't traced back to your internet service.
So you could send anonymous death threats
Or if there is ever a sporting event or something that is blacked out because it is local, the VPN will make it seem like you are not local.
Uh Oh Colby...UGA just took a big hit
Tyson Amundsen
Merit I will join your VPN four man bobsled team
Merit Egan
haha, ok I'm in
Edward Ekstrom
Virtual private network
It takes your requests and makes them from a server
So it looks like the traffic is coming from that server not your computer
So it's like your computer is on the server's local network
Does that make sense
You can also use it to have a LAN party over the Internet
Alex Platis
Edward can you confirm that using one will allow you to get away with torrenting?
Edward Ekstrom
Depends if they do it right.
If the users on their VPN are kept private, then yes
But I'm sure the company has a record of who makes which requests
But since your are torrenting and on a VPN, it would be very, very hard to track
Torrenting alone is really hard to track
Because you're downloading bits and pieces from a lot of different hosts(other user's computers).
Alex Platis
My old roommate got caught and they shut off his internet
He had to call the ISP and they lectured him before turning it back on
Tyson Amundsen
